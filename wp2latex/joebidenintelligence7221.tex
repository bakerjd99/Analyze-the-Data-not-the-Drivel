Joe Biden, the demented imbecile in the White House, recently had his,
``it will go away like a miracle'' (Trump) moment. His, ``the rise of
the oceans began to slow'' (Obama) moment. His, ``mission accomplished''
(Bush) moment. His, ``I did not have sex with that woman'' (Clinton)
moment. And his, ``I'm not a crook'' (Nixon) moment, and boy was it a
doozy!~\emph{The image of desperate Afghans falling off a plane bugging
out of Kabul will be the single defining image of the Biden years.}~The
global garbage media will attempt to divert the pig-dog-public's
attention, and they may even enjoy some short-term success, but fuckups
of this magnitude cannot be memory-holed.

I feel sorry for the Afghans, but I'm enjoying watching all this blow up
in Biden's moronic face. Unlike many, I was never taken in by his folksy
charm and carefully curated common-man touch. It was always a facade to
cover the vacuum within. How many times have we listened to this dipshit
curry favor with tales of his poor son's cancer death? Hey Joe, roughly
one-third of the American public can bore strangers with similar
stories. My own mother died a far more horrific cancer death than your
son and I don't use her sad fate to garner sympathy. You should be
ashamed of using your dead son as a political prop.

Now, Joe, I know this is not all your fault. The incompetent
intelligence agencies that allegedly serve you share the blame. It seems
that American intelligence
agencies\footnote{American Intelligence Agency, 
talk about an oxymoron.
} produce nothing
but~``Intelligence Failures.'' How many times have they egregiously
screwed up in recent decades? How many heads of the CIA, FBI, ATF, et
cetera have been sacked for gross incompetence? \emph{Why any of the
nitwits supposedly in charge of the Afghanistan withdrawal still have
jobs is entirely on you Joe!} Unless there are severe, immediate, and
career-ending consequences for ``Intelligence Failures'' you can expect
more of the same.
