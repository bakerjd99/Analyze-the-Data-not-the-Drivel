\end{floatingfigure} Christopher Nolan has made some excellent commercially successful films
like
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2010/07/28/the-20-seconds-that-ruined-inception/}{Inception},
\href{http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/}{The Dark Knight}, and
\href{http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/memento/}{Mememto}. When word got
out that he was working on a \emph{serious} science fiction film
expectations got out of hand. Those of us old enough to remember the
first screenings of 2001 thought maybe, just maybe, we might see
something comparable to Kubrick's masterpiece. Well I am sorry to report
that Interstellar is no
\href{http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-2001-a-space-odyssey-1968}{2001};
it's not even a \href{http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/}{Blade
Runner} or Nolan's own Inception. Interstellar is a giant, moderately
entertaining, incoherent mess.

Much has been made of \href{http://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/}{Kip
Thorne's} involvement with Interstellar. The Black Hole depicted in
Interstellar is based on General Relativity calculations. Apparently the
CGI animators uncovered something unexpected in how a spinning Black
Hole drags light around it. We are told the Black Hole in Interstellar
is the
\href{http://www.penny4nasa.org/2014/11/07/how-interstellar-black-hole-led-to-an-actual-scientific-discovery/}{most
technically accurate ever seen in the movies}. Unfortunately, it's the
only technically accurate part of the~whole damn movie.

There is no point going over the
\href{http://guycodeblog.mtv.com/2013/01/15/weird-boner-facts/}{boners}
in Interstellar. They are numerous, annoying, glaring, and embarrassing.
If you must torture yourself the
\href{http://www.slate.com/articles/health\_and\_science/space\_20/2014/11/interstellar\_science\_review\_the\_movie\_s\_black\_holes\_wormholes\_relativity.html}{Bad
Astronomer} has catalogued Intersellar's most egregious violations. Now
I know what you're thinking. John, it's a freaking sci-fi movie, lighten
up! You're going on like a character on the
\href{http://www.cbs.com/shows/big\_bang\_theory/}{Big Bang Theory.}

My answer to such ankle biters is simple. Science fiction is as an
\emph{Art Form}. An art form has two equal components: art and form!~
Art, without form, is usually effete garbage, and form, without art, is
an income tax return. Greatness only emerges when the two are in perfect
balance. The first step in achieving balance is honoring the basic
elements of the form. So what are the basic elements of the
\emph{serious science fictio}n form?

I've
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2014/09/01/pandoras-star-a-grand-sprawling-entertainment/}{gone
over this} before but clearly you weren't paying attention. Serious
science fiction differs~from fantasy in the way it treats reality.
Serious science fiction \emph{is allowed a few departures} from physical
reality. You can assume wormholes connect different parts of the
universe and that it's possible to safely traverse them but that's it
cowboy! Outside of wormholes it's physics as usual! This is the science
part in science fiction. Great science fiction strictly follows this
mandate. Take 2001, the exemplar of how this is done, anything
non-obelisk related in 2001, including HAL 9000, is completely and
absolutely plausible. The obelisk is the singular departure from reality
in 2001.

Interstellar bombs because it often departs from physical reality for
the basest of reasons: advancing a clunky nap inducing plot. I cannot
abide such transgressions. It's like watching a prima donna ballerina
stop in the middle of Swan Lake, drop her tutu, and take a dump on
stage. Now prima donna dumps may be entertaining but they're not ballet.
Similarly, Interstellar has its
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPiHQ37gXnE}{good parts} but it's
not serious science fiction. In my opinion Interstellar is a bigger
disappointment than
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/whats-the-opposite-of-transcendence/}{Transcendence}
and it makes we wonder if anyone in Hollyweird~is capable of making
serious science fiction these days.
