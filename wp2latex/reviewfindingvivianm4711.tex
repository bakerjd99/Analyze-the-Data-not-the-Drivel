I suffer from SLAM (\textbf{S}pouse that \textbf{L}ikes
\textbf{A}rt-house \textbf{M}ovies). I'm sure you're familiar with this
common affliction. It strikes when you want to see
\href{http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spiderman\_2/}{Spider-Man 2} but,
because you dearly love your spouse, you settle on some ``uplifting work
of art'' that can only be seen in a cramped, look around the pretentious
fathead ahead in front of you, dingy art-house cinema. SLAM suffers get
a break in St. Louis; there are only two art-house cinemas and their
usual yard-sale like fare is dull even by art-house standards. But, as
any yard-sale addict will tell you, there are diamonds in the debris and
Finding Vivian Maier is a gem.

\href{http://www.findingvivianmaier.com/}{Finding Vivian Maier} is a
documentary about a great street photographer, Vivian Maier (1926
--- 2009) that you have probably never heard of. I had never heard of her
and I'm a \href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/}{keen amateur}
photographer with a nagging interest in the history and technology of
photography. I've read
\href{http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8\&keywords=ansel+adams+the+camera\&tag=googhydr-20\&index=aps\&hvadid=28302426801\&hvpos=1t1\&hvexid=\&hvnetw=g\&hvrand=1899326277021743497\&hvpone=\&hvptwo=\&hvqmt=b\&hvdev=c\&ref=pd\_sl\_1mhliw1po6\_b}{all
three of Ansel Adams} classic camera books, plowed through many giant
histories of photography, and endured as many Photoshop and image
restoration tomes as I can stomach. I'm not an artist; I'm a
\emph{technisté!} A \emph{technisté} is someone who has technical
artistic skills but is not phony enough to be an \emph{artiste}. Vivian
Maier is an \emph{anti-technisté}. She's a true photographic artist that
showed astonishingly low levels of interest in the craft and technology
of photography.

Her story, as one lady in the film noted, is more interesting than her
work. Nobody had heard of Vivian before 2007. She isn't mentioned in
giant histories of photography published before 2007 so it's not
surprising I missed her. She worked most of her life as a nanny. She
didn't hang around with other photographers and she apparently never
made a serious effort to show her photographs. Even stranger, she rarely
printed her pictures and shot thousands of frames \emph{that she never
developed}. She must have been content to look at her negatives if even
that. This astounds me! I cannot tell if I have a good shot until I
``develop'' it. For most of her long life she snapped away in the
background and it's likely that her astonishing body of work would have
vanished if John Maloof hadn't bought a lot of her negatives at an
auction in 2007.

For Vivian the act of capture sufficed and what wonderful captures they
are. Her work is being
\href{http://www.vivianmaier.com/exhibitions-events/}{exhibited around
the world}. I will certainly be looking out for the next show coming my
way. You can \href{http://www.vivianmaier.com/}{see some of her pictures
here} and, for those of you that care, Finding Vivian Maier is much
better than Spider-Man 2.
