While slumming on the Internet I came across a woman complaining.
Imagine my astonishment! The
lady,\footnote{The complainer identified as female.}
let's call her Karen, had an esoteric complaint, it was:

\begin{quote}
The Pythagorean Theorem was known long before his birth. Calling the
theorem ``Pythagorean'' is a form of erasure.
\end{quote}

Oh my!

Apparently, attributing a well-known mathematical result to a person or
school associated with its long history erases others, and by
``others'' Karen means BIPOC'ky people.

Ok, Karen, I'll play.

You are correct that specific cases of the ``Pythagorean Theorem'' were
known long before Pythagoras. The most famous Babylonian mathematical
tablet YBC 7289, see Figure~\ref{fig:7510x0} on page~\pageref{fig:7510x0}, demonstrates that the Babylonians were aware
of the square case at least a thousand years before Pythagoras.

Other tablets indicate they also knew about Pythagorean triples: natural
number solutions of {\emph{a}\textsuperscript{2} + \emph{b}\textsuperscript{2} = \emph{c}\textsuperscript{2}}.

%Some Pythagorean Triples

The Babylonians weren't the only culture aware of the ``Pythagorean
Theorem.'' The Egyptians, Chinese, and Indians were all aware of special
cases and some, particularly the ancient Chinese and Indians, even came
up with \emph{sort-of-ok} proofs for particular cases like equilateral
right triangles. This is hardly surprising. I submit that anyone
building square houses or laying out rectangular fields is likely to
stumble on special cases of the Pythagorean theorem. It's a simple
matter to pace off the sides of a rectangular field and compare the
result to the diagonal. The \emph{Pythagorean Rule-of-Thum}b, to
distinguish it from the theorem, has been known forever. I wouldn't be
surprised if it was found in ice age cave paintings or aboriginal rock
art one day. But, as anyone that's ever-studied mathematics knows,
there's a big difference between a rule-of-thumb and a general proof,
and the first \emph{sort-of-ok} surviving general proof of the
Pythagorean Theorem has been attributed to none other than
Euclid.\footnote{The
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem}{Pythagorean Theorem
  Wikipedia} page describes Euclid's proof as \emph{axiomatic}. I
  consider this an overstatement.
} Karen, it's a shame that Euclid, the most famous name in mathematics,
has been erased.

I know that didn't go the way you wanted, but your complaint, when
divorced from postering, has merit. The custom of naming things after
alleged progenitors has a long-checkered history. Misattributions, or
``erasures'' using your term, are so common they have their own law:
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler\%27s_law_of_eponymy}{Stigler's
law of eponymy}. ``Stigler's Law states that no scientific
discovery is named after its original discoverer.'' In a nice bit of
self-reference, Stigler's Law applies to Stigler's Law. The ``law'' was
known before Stigler claimed it. It seems we naked apes love ``erasing''
others.

Now, Karen, it would be so-so nice if we could rename the Pythagorean
theorem after its ``first discover,'' but I suspect we will never know
who or when this occurred. If we opt for ``first prover'' then we have to
nail down what we mean by proof. If we're going to insist on
\emph{general ultra-anal formal axiomatic} proofs then you can
make a good case that the Pythagorean Theorem was not really ``proven''
until modern times as the Pythagorean Theorem is a good test case for
computer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant}{proof
assistants}: see \href{https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/}{Formalizing 100
Theorems}. Rechristening the ``Pythagorean Theorem'' is, to use an
annoying cliché, \emph{problematic}.

The only thing that makes sense is to strip away all eponymous names and
call the Pythagorean Theorem something forgettable like the
\emph{Right-Angle Triangle Side Length Theorem}. Fortunately, renaming
things will not damage mathematics. David Hilbert once famously
remarked, ``\href{https://quotefancy.com/quote/1237279/David-Hilbert-One-must-be-able-to-say-at-all-times-instead-of-points-straight-lines-and}{One
must be able to say all times -- instead of points, straight lines, and
planes -- tables, chairs, and beer mugs.}'' It's the mathematical
content that matters, not the language used to discuss the content. So
maybe the answer to eponymous Stiglerian erasure is extreme erasure.
Let's purge all traces of humanity from mathematics.
\href{https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/OPINIONS.html}{Some
cynics} might add that formal axiomatics has been pursuing this for over
a century already.
