For years I have distributed a
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons}{J Addon} called
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/}{JOD}. JOD stands for
\textbf{J} \textbf{O}bject \textbf{D}ictionary. JOD is a code database
for the J programming language. Instead of storing my J programs in text
files, \emph{like every other programmer in the world}, I break them
down into the smallest reusable units. In J parlance I split my scripts
into \emph{words.}

If you are an experienced programmer I wouldn't blame you for
questioning my sanity. What could possibly be gained by discounting good
old-fashioned, superbly supported, ASCII/UTF-8 text files? The short
answer, \emph{in trendy software
\href{http://ee.cleversoul.com/fun/engspeak.html}{engineer speak},} is
\href{http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsRefactoring}{refactoring}. JOD is a
refactoring engine that works at the J word level.

What does \emph{the word level} mean? Program text files are collections
of many ``words.'' They roughly correspond to sentences, paragraphs,
sections and chapters in ordinary books. When you \emph{reuse}, or
quote, a book you typically copy passages and paste them into new
contexts. Programmers call this cut and paste programming. We have all
cut and pasted; it's a software sin
\href{http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CopyAndPasteProgramming}{our} \href{http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CopyAndPasteProgramming}{prophets
are constantly nagging} us about! JOD minimizes cut and paste
programming. You no longer cut and paste or \emph{include} you simply
\texttt{get}
lists of words. J words are closer to English words than you might
expect: hence this dictionary approach pays big dividends!

With the
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2011/02/12/j-7-01-now-playing-in-your-browser/}{release
of J 7.01} it's become clear that Windows is no longer the preeminent J
platform. The new
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/System/Installation/J701/Gtk\#Install}{JGTK}
interface works well on Windows but it \emph{sings} on Linux. This is
hardly surprising. \href{http://www.gtk.org/}{GTK} originated in the
Linux/Unix world and still performs best there. Porting JOD to Linux has
been on my to-do list for years. The arrival of J 7.01 got me off my
butt.

JOD 0.9.3 is the first publicized Linux release. JOD code is 99\% J and
makes limited use of OS facilities. The port consisted of finding Linux
equivalents for a handful of Windows API calls. The always helpful J
community provided useful pointers. Joey Tuttle and Bill Lam basically
solved my Linux
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally\_unique\_identifier}{GUID}
and file handling problems. Thanks guys.

My biggest chore was updating
JOD online documentation. In recent months
\emph{Google Documents}\footnote{\emph{Google Documents} is no longer
with us (October 1, 2020) and nobody misses it. Google has
a long history of abandoning their creations. You're
a fool to rely on them!
}
 changed the format of
their word processing documents. Google provided an upgrade tool to
convert old documents to the new format but it:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Did not remap scores of old URLs to new URLs. I had to go through
  every document doing this one link at a time!
\item
  Totally wrecked a few documents. I reconstructed
  \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/blob/master/jod/history.md}{JOD
  Release Notes} from version control logs.
\end{enumerate}
Despite these irritants the new format is better. You can attach
comments and download documents in
\href{http://www.coolutils.com/Formats/ODT}{ODT}, PDF, Word, HTML and
ZIP formats. If you find problems with my documents please leave notes.

I am not completely satisfied with some restrictions imposed by JOD
0.9.3.

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  JOD creates dictionaries in user home directories like
  \texttt{/home/user/jod/...} and assumes it has the rights to create,
  write, copy and erase JOD files and directories.
\item
  No blanks in file paths, i.e., \texttt{/home/i like blanks/but jod doesnt/...}
  will not work.
\item
  Dictionary paths must begin with a forward slash, i.e., \texttt{/home/is/ok/}
  but \ensuremath{\sim}\texttt{is/nada}
\item
  Volume sizing reports the smallest amount of free space on all mounted
  volumes and not the free space on the volume containing JOD
  directories. I just don't know how to do this on Linux.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/blob/master/joddocument/pdfdoc/jod.pdf}{jod.pdf} has not been
  updated.
\end{enumerate}
I am sure there are other problems and limitations that I have missed.
For more see:
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/tree/master/jod/joddoc}{Linux
Notes}. I will be releasing fixes and upgrades via
\href{https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Pacman}{Pacman} and on
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/}{the JOD page}. Give
JOD a whirl. It might change your J ways.
