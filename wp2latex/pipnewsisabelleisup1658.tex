Before my fall I launched a PIP (Perpetual Impossible Project). PIPs are
long-range risky undertakings that cannot be finished. PIPs
contradict and subvert the very notion of tightly controlled corporate
style projects: hence their manifest appeal to recusants like myself.

I won't go into details about my particular PIP. Let's just say it
captures every delusional notion I have ever entertained. Part of my
project involved installing a few Proof Assistants. Proof assistants are
programs that \href{http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/}{verify formal
mathematical proofs.} There are many proof assistant programs available.
These programs are not mathematical magic bullets. They don't prove
theorems and they don't make the job of ``theorem proving'' easier. To
use a programming analogy: a traditional proof is like
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode}{pseudo code} while a
formal proof is like an
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly\_language}{assembly
language} program. If you have ever written a nontrivial assembly
language program you have some idea of the sheer effort required to
produce a formal proof.

\emph{So, if formal proof only makes mathematics more difficult, why
bother? This is like asking, so if implementing pseudo code only makes
programming more difficult, why bother?}
