\end{floatingfigure} I
have pushed out a
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/}{JOD update} that
makes it possible to run the addon on J 8.02 systems. In the last eight
months a \href{http://qt-project.org/}{QT} based
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Guides/Qt\%20IDE}{J IDE} has been
developed that runs on Linux, Windows and Mac platforms. To maintain
JOD's compatibility across all versions of J from 6.02 on I had to tweak
a few verbs.

The only significant changes are how JOD interacts with various J system
editors. I have tested the system on Windows J 6.02, J 7.01, J 8.02,
and Mac J 7.01 systems. I expect it will behave on 32 and 64 bit Linux
systems from J 7.01 on, but I have yet to test these setups. My hardware
budget limits my ability to run common variants of Windows, Linux and
Mac systems.

JOD is still not complete; that's why the version number has not been
bumped past 1.0.0. The missing features are noted in the table of
contents of \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/blob/master/joddocument/pdfdoc/jod.pdf}{jod.pdf}, (also
available in the
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/joddocument}{joddocument
addon}), with the suffix ``NIMP,'' which means ``not implemented.'' I
will fill in these blanks as I need them. Most of the time JOD meets my
needs so don't hold your breath.

If you want to make your own additions to JOD
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod}{the program} and
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/joddoc}{documentation source} is
available on GitHub. Just follow the links and enjoy.

As a last note: I will be at the
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Community/Conference2014}{J
Conference in Toronto (July 24 and 25, 2014)} where I will be giving a
short presentation and handing out a few hardcopy versions of the JOD
manual to one or two JOD fans.
