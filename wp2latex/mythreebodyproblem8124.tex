\label{fig:8124x0} \end{floatingfigure} I have a three-body problem. Today, while wandering in our local
\emph{Barnes \& Noble,} I spotted, for the n\textsuperscript{th} time, a
boxed set edition of Cixin Liu's \href{https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-three-body-problem-cixin-liu/1119317099}{\emph{Three-Body Problem}} (TBP). Once
again, I resisted the urge to snatch the books off the shelf, pony up
whatever B\&N was asking, and ferry TBP home for a \emph{proper}
reading. Yes, I haven't read this widely lauded epic! If I hadn't sat
through two TBP TV series, I would have succumbed to temptation, but my
Three-Body problem reared its ugly head and circumvented my purchase. My
Three-Body problem is simple. I watched the movie before reading the
book. \emph{Books never ruin movies, but movies do ruin books.} Sadly, I
suspect the \emph{Three-Body Problem} has been irreparably wrecked by
the dismal TV series I foolishly watched. Don't let this happen to you!
\emph{Never see the movie before reading the book.}

Let's consider some cases.

\emph{1984:} There have been several attempts to make a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four}{1984
movie}; they are all horrible. The book is a goddamn masterpiece that
has only grown more relevant with time. I'm grateful I read \emph{1984}
a few times before subjecting myself to its pathetic film versions.

\emph{Brave New World (BNW):} I liked BNW more than \emph{1984} in my
dissolute youth. But I think it's safe to say that \emph{1984} is the
superior work. \emph{1984} is a timeless condemnation of leviathan
totalitarian states. It will never lose its punch. \emph{Brave New
World,} on the other hand, seems dated and silly. As an adolescent, I enjoyed the 
sex in the novel and was intrigued by the
scientifically engineered hierarchical society. I pictured myself as an
\emph{alpha} banging a long line of \emph{beta} broads. BNW is still
worth dipping into, especially if you're a horny teenager, but I would
strongly advise avoiding the recent \href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9814116/}{BNW TV series}. It reduces
an already adolescent book to drivel.

\emph{Frankenstein:} Don't get me started. \emph{Frankenstein} is
perhaps the most thoroughly debased masterpiece in the English language.
Every film and TV version of \emph{Frankenstein} utterly misses the
depths of the novel. In my ideal world, the directors, producers,
actors, and other \emph{hollyweirdos} that have sodomized
\emph{Frankenstein} would be tried for crimes against literature and
summarily canceled. Stop watching \emph{Franken-stools} and read the
fucking book.

\emph{Ulysses:} Why anyone would even attempt a film adaptation of this
book is beyond me. \emph{Ulysses} is a work of pure literature. You must
read it -- more than once -- to even begin to appreciate its stunning
wordplay. I suspect Joyce purposefully created a work that cannot be
truncated, translated, or ever turned into a movie. When he was writing
\emph{Ulysses}, movies were already butt-fucking books. I'm sure Joyce
noticed such depravities and strived to immunize \emph{Ulysses} from
``visual'' treatments. Nevertheless, some idiots couldn't resist making
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(1967_film)}{Ulysses the movie}---abstain from such abominations.

\emph{The Bible:} Yeah, let's go there. How many movies, TV shows, and
series have been ripped from \emph{The Bible}? How many are any good?
Even entertaining epics like Heston's ``Moses Moses'' suck like Satan
sodomizing Solomon. Considering the deluge of wretched Biblical visual
adaptations, maybe the Muslim threat to go full jihad on your infidel ass
if you dare ``visualize'' Mohammed isn't such a bad idea.

As you can see, I'm not a fan of turning books into movies. In most
cases, the movie is a low-rent facsimile of the book, but there are
\emph{decent} adaptations.

\emph{Dune:} The recent \emph{Dune} films are decent. They're a serious
attempt to depict a vision of the novel. I enjoyed both, but I'm glad I
read the book first. The book conveys a sense of time that is missing in the
movies. The films also change things, perhaps unavoidably, so again,
read the book first.

\emph{The Lord of the Rings} (LOTR): LOTR has the finest visual
adaptation of any epic. I am excluding the \href{https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2012/12/16/king-hobbit-kong/}{\emph{Hobbit}} horrors that followed
and confining myself to the standard, well-edited theater release, not
the bloated extended version. Jackson and his crew did a fine job
creating three immensely entertaining films. I loved all three and agree
that LOTR is the \href{https://www.nerdsandbeyond.com/2021/12/16/stephen-colbert-friends-crown-the-lord-of-the-rings-as-the-1-trilly/}{``best trilly''} ever. But the books are still better. Trust me, it's not even
close.

Finally, believe it or not, extremely rare films are
better than the book. Many consider the classic Judy Garland
\emph{Wizard of Oz} to be better than Baum's book, but even here,
respected critics like \href{https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1125174.The_Wizard_of_Oz_and_Who_He_Was}{Martin Gardner} disagree.
It's just better to always read the book first.

All of which brings me back to my Three-Body Problem. I've polluted my
mind with two TV series. I watched a competent
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Body}{Chinese production} and
\href{https://www.netflix.com/title/81024821}{Netflix's hack job}. The
Chinese version is loaded with predictable CCP ass-kissing but still
manages to outclass Netflix's woke wet work. The Netflix version changed
the sex, race, and nationalities of major characters without any
artistic justification! Jackson had to leave a lot out when making
LOTR, but he didn't rape central characters. The Netflix TBP tools are
like the deranged climate jerk-offs that have been throwing paint on
museum paintings. Given such contempt for source material, I must ask
myself, ``What the hell else is missing?'' The TBP novels have been
called \emph{cerebral}. Cerebral means you must think --- something that
is utterly beyond Netflix nitwits. Now, I must read TBP to cauterize the
wounds left by the TV series, and instead of a joyous exploration of a
new universe, it will be a homework assignment: a tedious triage trilogy.
