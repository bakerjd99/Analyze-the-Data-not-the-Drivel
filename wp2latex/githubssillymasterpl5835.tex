The kids at \href{https://github.com/}{GitHub} have tested positive for
Mad Woke Disease (MWD) - \emph{again!}

The last outbreak was over
\href{https://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2018/10/22/sqlite_code_of_conduct/}{codes
of conduct} this time it's about naming Git repository \emph{master
branches!} If you're wondering what's a Git \emph{master branch} and why
infantile \emph{wokesters} are acting out I envy you. Perhaps you should
stop reading now. MWD is a pathetic mental illness. It robs sufferers of
perspective and judgement and often induces inane bouts of vacuous
virtue signaling.

Still here - you were warned - let's dig into the tiresome
technicalities.

GitHub is a major website that hosts tens of thousands of
\href{https://git-scm.com/}{Git code repositories}. Code repositories
are specialized databases that track \emph{program component} changes.
The most commonly tracked components are source code files but other
binary components like image files are also tracked. Code repositories
make it possible for widely dispersed programmers to collaborate on
large projects without \emph{irreversibly} wreaking each other's work.
Hence, GitHub and it's \href{https://bitbucket.org/}{competitors},
matter to software developers.

So what's this master branch?

Program code evolves like living organisms and just like relationships
between organisms are shown on ``tree of life'' diagrams program
relationships are displayed on repository branch diagrams. Complex
programs have pedigrees that look like \emph{inbred} royal family trees.

Book} and \href{https://endjin.com/blog/}{endjin} blog.}

\end{figure}

If you look closely at the left side of the next diagram you'll
notice that the line of green dots beside the inbreeding graphic is
labeled \textbf{``master''}.

I know what you're thinking. How did white supremacists infiltrate the
woke thinking denizens of GitHub and embed racially loaded terms like
``master'' in code repositories? Obviously, wherever the word ``master''
occurs it's referring to slavery and the brutal suppression of people of
color\footnote{``People of color'' is woke but the transposition ``colored people''
  is not! The improper use of word order or pronouns is now a capital
  offense. First time offenders will be let off with a Twitter beating
  but if you persist, like some nagging \emph{people of vagina}, it's straight
  to the burning pyre for you.
} because \emph{words % \protect\hyperlink{fn1}{\textsuperscript{1}}
have only one meaning and context is always irrelevant}. To atone for
their terminological sins GitHub is planning to rename the ``master''
branch something \emph{currently} innocuous like ``main''.

With all the shit plugging global toilets why did GitHub's plumbers
choose this silly turd to flush?

The use of the word ``master'' is a longstanding Git convention. Unlike
other branches the master branch cannot be renamed. This is a minor
annoyance and I support efforts to \emph{allow} other words but having a
fixed name for the master branch has advantages. It simplifies automatic
program builds as they don't have to determine what the master branch is
called today. If the master branch is forcibly renamed it will break
thousands of builds all over the world. Think of it as a digital black
lives matter riot.

Here are a few rhetorical questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the ``master'' branch is renamed ``main'' will it fix racism?
\item
  Will renaming the master branch demonstrably improve a single black
  life?
\item
  What will we call Chess %\protect\hyperlink{fn2}{\textsuperscript{2}}?
  Grandmasters\footnote{Contrary to widespread woke opinion ``Grandmaster'' is not a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Wizard}{KKK rank}}?
\item
  Must we rename Masters Degrees to Main Degrees?
\item
  What about the Master's Golf Tournament?
\item
  Or masterclasses?
\end{itemize}

And, it goes without saying, that we can never \emph{master} anything,
\emph{in the sense of high achievement}, ever again because because it's % \protect\hyperlink{fn3}{\textsuperscript{3}}.
clearly \emph{woke racist}\footnote{\emph{Woke racism} should not be confused with real
  racism.
