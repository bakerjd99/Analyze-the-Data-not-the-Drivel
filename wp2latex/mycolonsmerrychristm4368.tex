I have just returned from my second colonoscopy. For all you
indestructible young'ins out there a colonoscopy is a medical procedure
that basically entails stuffing a camera up your butthole to look for
evil-doers. Thankfully you're knocked out during the procedure and when
you come to you remember about as much as

anal probe abductees}. Colonoscopies can detect and remove precancerous
polyps in the colon; it's a rare cost-effective procedure that actually
saves lives. If you're an old fart that hasn't been probed I would
suggest you ask your doctor about colonoscopies.

My colonoscopy went well. No polyps were found so I don't have to do
this again for ten years. The best thing about colonoscopies: the
pictures. If you're into colon porn prepare to feast your eyes otherwise
avert them because you will never be able to \emph{unsee} what follows.
The notes on my report noted the ``good colon preparation'' which, in
the immortal words of~John Harvey Kellogg played by Anthony Hopkins in
the definitive crazy health nut mocking movie
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLUPJR6wz-I}{The Road to
Wellville}, means ``my colon is clean.''
