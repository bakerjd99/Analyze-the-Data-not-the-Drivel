The original
\href{http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1092277-wizard\_of\_oz/}{Wizard of
Oz}, the one we have all seen many times, is on a very short list of
nearly perfect movies. Everything about the 1939 film is superb in
excess. It's as fun to watch today as it was over seventy years ago and
you cannot \emph{honestly} say that about many films. Because Oz
is such a towering film classic it has overshadowed all cinematic attempts to
reenter and reimagine \href{http://www.online-literature.com/baum/}{Frank L. Baum's} world.
Without exception every Oz wanna-be, and there have been many, suck like
motivated gay prostitutes. Perhaps if we hadn't seen the original,
\href{http://disney.go.com/thewizard/}{Oz the Great and Powerful}, might
be judged a ``good'' film, but we have and this overblown
homage underscores, yet again, the magnificence of the 1939 Oz. I have
some advice for Baum fans. If you want to reimagine his world --- read
his damn books! Believe it or not the book,
\href{http://www.booksshouldbefree.com/book/the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz}{The
Wizard of Oz}, is as good, if not better than the film classic. As for
film makers --- just stop it! Oz is close to sacred ground; if you're
not a Kubrick-level cinematic genius, \emph{and very few of you are,}
all you're going to do is embarrass yourself and induce Dorothy
nostalgia in your audience.

Watching Oz the Great and Powerful (OGP) has its own minor schizophrenic
charms. On the good witch side OGP is another stunning special effects
extravaganza. 21\textsuperscript{st} century movies are now in a weird
place; if you can~imagine it you can~render it on the screen. If the
ancient Greeks had a god of special movie effects it's unlikely he could
top your average contemporary big budget --- tiny brain --- movie. For
decades producers and directors have strived to out-effect each other
and they've finally ended up in a place Sophocles would recognize. Real
improvements in modern movies can come from only one place: better
stories! It was the telling of the story that distinguished the 1939 Oz.
They took brilliant source material and merged it with equally brilliant
songs. This is incredibly difficult and rarely achieved. In OGP's case
they didn't even try. The suits that ruin Disney these days have a
reputation for phoning stories in. With OGP they've out
\href{http://disney.go.com/johncarter/}{John Carter'ed} themselves. I
believe a bad Oz witch went all premenstrual on the screen writers. How
else can you explain the transformation of classic source material into
