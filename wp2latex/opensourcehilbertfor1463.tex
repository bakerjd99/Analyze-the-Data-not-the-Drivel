\end{floatingfigure}While searching for free
\href{http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002Y27P3M}{Kindle}
books I found \href{http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main\_Page}{Project
Gutenberg}. Project Gutenberg offers free Kindle books but they also
have something better! Would you believe \LaTeX\ source code for
some mathematical classics.

The best book I've found so far is an English translation of David
Hilbert's \href{http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17384}{\emph{Foundations
of Geometry}}. Hilbert's \emph{Foundations} exposed some flaws in the
ancient treatment of Euclidean geometry and recast the subject with
modern axioms. Because it's relatively easy to follow, compared to
Hilbert's more recondite publications, this little book exercised
disproportionate influence on 20\textsuperscript{th} century mathematics. We still see its
style aped, but rarely matched, in mathematics texts today.

I couldn't resist the temptation of compiling a mathematical classic so
I eagerly downloaded the source and ran it through \LaTeX.
\emph{Foundations} compiled without problems and generated a nice
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter\_(paper\_size)}{letter-sized}
PDF. Letter-size is fine but I was looking for free Kindle books! I
decided to invest a little energy modifying the source to produce a
Kindle version. Project Gutenberg makes it clear that we are free to
modify the source. Isn't open source wonderful!

Converting \emph{Foundations} was simple. The main \LaTeX\ file
included 52 \texttt{*.png} illustrations with hard-coded widths in
\verb|\includegraphics| commands. I wrote a
\href{http://www.box.net/shared/prbdlqpysa2zmugelzye}{J script that
converted all these fixed widths} to relative
\verb|\textwidth|'s. This lets \LaTeX\ automatically
resize images for arbitrary page geometries. When compiled with Kindle
page dimensions this fixed most of the illustrations. I had to tweak a
few \texttt{wragfig}'s to better typeset images surrounded by text. The result is
a very readable
\href{http://www.box.net/shared/7gzg1ssu5gddr953et6h}{Kindle oriented
PDF version of Hilbert's book}. There are still a few problems. The
Table of Contents is a plain \texttt{tabular} that does not wrap well and one
table rolls off the right Kindle margin. Neither of these deficiencies
seriously impair the readability of the text. If these defects annoy you
download the
\href{http://www.box.net/shared/p6zmknarsscnrci8vj8o}{Project Gutenberg
source with my modifications} and build your own version.

This little experiment convinced me that providing free classic books,
in source code form, is a service to
\href{http://www.articlesbase.com/writing-articles/is-mankind-sexist-1836076.html}{mankind}.
Not only does it allow you to ``publish'' classics on new media it also
fundamentally changes your attitude toward books. Hilbert was one of the
great mathematical geniuses of the 19\textsuperscript{th} and 20\textsuperscript{th} century. It's hard to
suppress \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FucbvoFFy0}{we are not
worthy} moments and maintain a sharp critical eye when reading his
``printed'' works. You don't get the same vibe when reading raw
\LaTeX. Source code puts you in a, \emph{it's just another bug
infested program}, frame of mind. You expect errors in code and you
typically find them. This is exactly the hard-nosed attitude you need
when reading mathematics.
