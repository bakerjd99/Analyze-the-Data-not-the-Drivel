Are
you an
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard\_C.\_Hoagland}{unscrupulous
deranged crank} with the track record of a government budget forecaster?
Do you have \href{http://www.bennyhinn.org/default.cfm}{no shame and
assume everyone around you is an inbred moron?} Can you say one thing
one day and the opposite the next and see no contradiction? Do you
consider ``evidence''
\href{http://blogcritics.org/scitech/article/is-science-just-another-opinion/}{to
be shit that you make up} whenever you feel like separating fools from
their money? If you answered yes to any of these questions then you
might have a bright future as a 2012 entrepreneur.

But you have to act fast. End of the World deals
\href{http://www.bible.ca/pre-date-setters.htm}{only come around every
few years.} Seize the moment \emph{or you may have to wait months}
before the next opportunity to scam credulous dolts. My advice: strike
while the iron is hot. After 2012 the only people making any money on
2012 will be
\href{http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/64430612.html}{sour skeptics
telling us I told you} so and we all know how much that pays.

Since we have no qualms our only problem is marketing. We have to find
the right 2012 product. The field is getting crowded and we must
exercise caution. 2012 entrepreneurs welcome competition like drugged
out bike gangs welcome competition. With this in mind we have to rule
out:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Movies: \href{http://www.whowillsurvive2012.com/}{2012} opens this
  weekend and if \href{http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/2012/}{the
  critics can be believed} we now have a viable substitute for water
  boarding and
  \href{http://www.flickr.com/photos/neloqua/294329338/}{Itsy, bitsy,
  teenie, weenie, yellow polka dot bikini} looping endlessly.
\item
  TV specials: The
  \href{http://boards.history.com/topic/History-Now/History-Channels-2012/520029478}{History
  Channel} has locked up this market segment with one mind draining
  special after another. If I even see the number 2012 on the History
  Channel again I will climb up the nearest Mayan pyramid and cut my own
  heart out!
\item
  Survival gear:
  \href{http://2012base.com/Products\_and\_Merchandise/Survival\_Equipment/}{What's
  a girl to wear when the world ends.} Get your end of the world gear
  now before the panic, or intelligence, sets in.
\item
  \href{http://t-shirts.cafepress.com/2012?cmp=knc--g--us--pol--apparel--search-e--2012\_tee\_shirts\&utm\_medium=cpc\&utm\_source=google\&utm\_campaign=pol--apparel\&utm\_content=search-e\&utm\_term=2012\_tee\_shirts}{T-Shirts:
  Every disaster needs one.}
\item
  \href{http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1818574/how\_to\_throw\_a\_december\_21\_2012\_end.html?cat=60}{End
  of the World Party Catering:} Annihilation on an empty stomach is so
  2011.
\item
  \href{http://www.exploringlifesmysteries.com/2012-planetary-alignment}{Mayan
  Resort Holidays:} This one actually makes some sense. The prospect of
  heaping scorn on scores of new and old age nitwits on December 22,
  2012 would warm my cold skeptical core.
\end{enumerate}
Let's face it breaking into the 2012 market is hard. It takes an
imaginative opportunistic whore to come up with a market worthy 2012
scam. I'm out of ideas; maybe you can do better.
