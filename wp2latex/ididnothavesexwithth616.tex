months of heroic attempts to contain the spill with

it's finally dawning on the powerful minds that rule us that fluids
cannot be bought-off, community-organized, press-marginalized or
change-the-channel ignored. Reality is such an unfair bitch.

Last night, sensing a disturbance in the zeitgeist, Obama subjected our
nation to a rousing
\emph{\href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh76oepKFc8}{I did not have
sex with that oil spill speech}}. The One's words soared but we, the
little unworthy peons, were as unmoved as
\href{http://www.aolnews.com/opinion/article/opinion-why-this-is-the-iconic-gulf-oil-spill-picture/19503566}{oil
soaked pelicans}. Even our
\href{http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=obamabot}{Obamabot}
leg tinglers failed to detect
\href{http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2010/06/15/msnbc\_trashes\_obamas\_address\_compared\_to\_carter\_i\_dont\_sense\_executive\_command.html}{executive
command}.

I wish I could say I am disappointed but I wrote this government off a
longtime ago. The stark fiscal, technical and rhetorical incompetence
they display every day is no more surprising than sunshine. The oil
spill is an infuriating accidental disaster but it's not the biggest
spill confronting us. That would be our insane, reckless and entirely
\href{http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2009/03/19/obama-speak-homeland-security-secretary-replaces-terrorism-term-man-caus}{man
caused} deficit spending.

Let's do some arithmetic. Let's assume the unhinged moonbats turned
reservoir engineers have pulled the correct gulf spill rate of 100,000
barrels/day out of their asses. Let's also assume an oil price of \$80
dollars/barrel. When you multiply everything together you find that
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
8000000 = 1e5 * 80
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
eight millions dollars of oil is spilling into the gulf every day.
Sounds bad. Let's compare that to our government's fiscal spill. The
deficit for this fiscal year is expected to approach
\href{http://www.usdebtclock.org/}{1.3 trillion dollars}. This works out
to
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
3.56164384e9 = 1.3e12 % 365
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
roughly 3.6 billion dollars/day or \emph{445 times the gulf spill rate!}
If I could plug only one damn hole I know which one I'd choose!
