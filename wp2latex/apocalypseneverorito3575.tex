Let's begin with an apology to the Mayan's. There's not a whit of
verified historical evidence that the ancient Mayans predicted the end
of the world or that they were any more upset about cycles in their
calendars than we are in ours. Modern Mayans repeatedly
\href{http://boingboing.net/2009/10/13/what-actual-mayans-a.html}{pointed
this out} but arguing with new age morons, schizophrenic doom mongers
and pure outright rapacious hucksters is a thankless task. Crazy ideas
are easy to market. Just look at who we vote for, the consumer crap that
fills our homes, the twaddle that we ludicrously label news and the
sheer reams of reason suffocating rubbish that infuses the very core of
our increasingly derelict civilization. Believe me; I completely
understand the hygienic appeal of apocalypse. A clean, moron free,
slate: oh what a glorious day that would be!

Well, it's not the end of the world but it's still a glorious day
because the day after the world ends is when skeptics celebrate global
\emph{\textbf{I told You So Day}.} On I told you so day sane and
rational people get to rub it in and remind delusional nitwits
everywhere that they've been suckered again. My only regret is I told
you so day requires a degree of sanity among the insane. Anyone that
fell for Mayan doomsday drivel is now rapidly forgetting it and the very
craziness that abetted the belief is now rapidly erasing it. Genuinely
crazy people aren't rational enough to recognize their errors making
them poor I told you so targets. As for hucksters: they're already
working the next scam. Skeptics just
