Oh Mohammed in a brothel how much more of this idiocy can we endure? A
certain brain-damaged official,
(\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas\_Perez}{Thomas Perez}), in
the US Department of Justice apparently thinks allowing Universities to
experiment with
\href{http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/Why-did-feds-claim-Kindle-violates-civil-rights\_-1006723-99801389.html}{delivering
textbooks via the Kindle violates the civil rights of the blind.} This
so is mind-boggling stupid that I thought it was a bad joke. Well it is
a joke and it's on us! We are entering the final stages of
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry\_Pournelle}{Pournellian Iron
Law} paralysis in the United States. Remember a vote for any Democrat
anywhere is a vote for submission to morons like Perez.
