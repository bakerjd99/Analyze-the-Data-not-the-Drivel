\end{floatingfigure} There are two types of stories about major astronomical observatories.
There are stories about new discoveries and observation technologies and
then there are stories about how batshit crazy people are! Lately a
\href{http://www.popsci.com/contentious-mauna-kea-telescope-website-downed-cyberattack}{rash
of batshit crazy} has broken out over the construction of the
\href{http://www.tmt.org/}{Thirty Meter Telescope} on Mauna Kea. The
ignorant press is casting the story as another tale of wanton
destruction of sacred pristine aboriginal environments by ``big
astronomy.'' On most days I ignore the moron maelstrom but I'm in bad
mood today. I couldn't resist venting on
\href{http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/27/environmental_protestors_hack_hawaiian_telescope_site/}{The
Register}. The following is a slightly edited version of my
\emph{contribution to the conversation} bitches!

You are making way too much sense. As a long-standing amateur astronomer
and aficionado of major observatories I can state with absolute
certainty that if you want to preserve the environment around a mountain
one of the best ways to do it is to place a major observatory on it.
Large telescopes require large dark zones. If people would turn their
damn lights off at night development in dark zones might be permissible
but as you are well aware people will not turn their fucking lights off
and will look at you like you've just beamed down from starship Looney
Tunes if you try to tell them that \href{http://www.darksky.org/}{light
pollution is a real thing.} The only way to insure a dark environment is
to restrict development and, as you point out, that limits how much
money certain cretins can extract. What's happening on Mauna Kea
happened before on Mount Graham in Arizona. So called environmentalists
fought for decades to block the \href{http://www.lbto.org/}{Large
Binocular Telescope} because it might stress some squirrels. Well the
scope got built and the
\href{http://mgio.arizona.edu/sites/mgio/files/mgrscensus2010.pdf}{squirrels
are doing just fine} and will continue to thrive because their habitat
will not be sodomized by condo developers and other invasive lower life
forms.

Mixed in with all this phony eco-warrior nonsense is even more phony
religious nonsense. I realize it is horribly judgmental and privileged
white male of me to say that sky fairies of all types, even ``protected
class'' aboriginal brown people sky fairies, are complete and utter
rubbish! Jesus did not rise from the dead, Mohammed did not ascend to
heaven, and Pele is not stomping around on Mauna~Kea regardless of what
native Hawaiians believe. If this offends you demonstrate why your sky
fairy is any less imaginary than \href{http://www.venganza.org/}{The
Flying Spaghetti Monster}. ``Belief'' is a bullshit word. It will be a
pathetic day if the construction of a major 21\textsuperscript{st}
century observatory is stopped to placate scientific illiterates and
religious primitives.
