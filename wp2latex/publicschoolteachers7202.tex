 \end{floatingfigure} One of the many positive things to emerge from the Coronavirus pandemic
is the renewed interest of parents in just what the fuck is going on in
their children's schools. Like many pandemic perks this wasn't planned,
but when kids were expelled from their classrooms and parents were sent
home from their jobs, both ended up staring into the ugly
\href{https://zoom.us/}{Zoomed} abyss of public education. It's safe to
say many did not like what they saw!

First, we had inane, \emph{over-the-top-reactions}, to what some
``teachers''\footnote{The intellectual pygmy that phoned this in reminded all of us just how
  awful some public school teachers are. Can we please just fire some of
  these dipshits?
} saw in the
bedrooms of their students.
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/us/student-suspended-gun-virtual/index.html}{Imagine
getting suspended over a toy gun in the background} of a video call.
Then the usual suspects chimed in with earnest screeds about how
\href{https://www.the74million.org/article/how-missing-zoom-classes-could-funnel-kids-into-the-juvenile-justice-system-and-why-some-experts-say-now-is-the-time-to-reform-truancy-rules/}{students
aren't showing up}. Maybe hectoring over Zoom backgrounds wasn't such a
good idea! Nah! Finally, teachers zeroed in on important issues like
should students
\href{https://www.smartclassroommanagement.com/2020/08/22/students-pajamas-zoom-lessons/}{be
allowed to wear pajamas during Zoom lessons?} When parents dared
question this nonsense they were harassed on \emph{Twatter} and

\emph{FarceBook}.\footnote{I will never utter the \emph{preferred names} of these social network
  abominations again!} \emph{Jesus Christopher Christ and Mohammed blowing Buddha in a mud
bath!} It's like public school teachers and administrators were going
out of their way to affirm our low opinion of
them.\footnote{In my university days, anyone pursuing an ``Education Degree'' was
dismissed as an intellectual
lightweight.} %\protect\hyperlink{fn3}{\textsuperscript{3}}

As bad as U.S. public education was in the late \emph{paleoboomer} era
(the 1970s), it's clearly gotten worse. Schools at all levels, are
carrying
\href{https://www.huffpost.com/entry/higher-ed-administrators-growth_n_4738584}{appalling
loads of parasitic administrators}. To be fair a lot of the
administrative bullshit schools deal with has been imposed by government
dickheads. Still, it remains absolutely true that schools are no more
difficult to manage today than they were a century ago, but boy do we
waste far more time and money administering them. We should recoil
at such waste but remember, it's good for the union parasites and
other bottom-feeding underachievers that infest public schools. I mean,
what would these people do? They'd immediately have to camp with the
rest of the \emph{useless
unhoused.}\footnote{  The ``homeless'' are now to be called ``unhoused.'' Apparently, the
  word ``homeless'' acquired a negative connotation. Maybe it had
  something to do with observing the
  ``unhoused.''
}

All the trivial demeaning pseudo-academic rot in public schools might
have remained safely under the fat-ass-public's radar but pandemic Zoom
shoved it in their faces. Suddenly, even disinterested, \emph{we don't
give a shit about our children's education,} parents started wondering
about the crap being ``taught'' in schools. As ghastly as much of this
was, it was CRT that really woke up the non-woke!

I am not going to get into CRT. Even in its most austere and respected
academic form, it's nothing more than another foul product of
\emph{garbage academia.} Its luminaries are, at best, mediocre
scholars\footnote{  CRT is so frivolous that even the Nobel Peace Prize committee won't
  touch it.
}, and the ``theory''
is a simple observation that the dominant majority group in society
tends to structure society to serve their interests. \emph{Well, golly
fucking duh!}

Yes, the U.S. is largely a society that favors whites just like Japan is
a society that largely favors Asians and Nigeria is a society that
largely favors blacks. Dominant group supremacy is a pernicious and
persistent feature of \emph{all} human societies. This is not a uniquely
white failing; it's a human failing. Rarified CRT, the theory that's
\href{https://dailycaller.com/2021/07/29/critical-race-theory-law-school-antiracism/}{not
taught in public schools}, implicitly concedes this point but the
dumbed-down version\footnote{  Pretty much anything taught in U.S. public schools nowadays is dumbed
  down.
} that's crept into schools and alarmed parents basically blames whitey for all
the bad shit and demands reparations.

\textbf{I don't give a crap about CRT, or the people bitching about CRT,

\end{quote}

Public schools are public institutions; it's right in the damn name!
What goes on in public schools should be fully open to the public. You
should be able to hop on \href{https://duckduckgo.com/}{DuckDuckGo} and
quickly lookup exhaustive lists of all the workbooks, textbooks,
software, and other curriculum materials used in any school nationwide.
You should also be able to pull up course syllabi; i.e.~what the hell
are teachers planning to teach, for any public school course anywhere.

Here's a little homework assignment for you. Go look up the history
textbooks (if any) used for 9\textsuperscript{th} graders in your school
district. How about 5\textsuperscript{th}-grade math workbooks? If
you're lucky you might find a few references but for most school
districts you'll pull up what database people call a big fat null: also
called nada, zip, or pound sand peon! As most school districts are
dripping in under-employed administrators you might think they would post curricula.
Nah! Basically, our so-called public schools
don't give a crap about public accountability.

This all came to a head in what's turning out to be another David versus
Goliath court case over, would you believe it, curriculum materials. It
all started with a Rhode Island mother making
\href{https://nypost.com/2021/08/05/teachers-union-sues-mom-over-requests-for-crt-curriculum-info/}{a
simple request for CRT curriculum materials}. She wanted to know if her
child was being taught CRT. What an affront! I'm pretty sure if she had
asked about geometry the school would have happily complied,
but CRT is too important to allow mere parents to interfere. The school
system declared the nuisance mom a bitchy \href{https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/karen/}{``Karen''} and advised
fornicating elsewhere. Then the \href{https://www.nea.org/}{NEA} piled on, and it's off to the courts
to litigate another total bullshit case.


Here's my suggestion to curb this crap. Many cops are now required to
wear body cameras to hold them accountable when they abuse their
authority. Public school teachers should also be required to wear body
cameras. If every teacher knew that their dodgy behavior and
off-curriculum rants might be splashed all over the Internet they might
drop the drivel and get back to, I don't know, actual school lessons!
