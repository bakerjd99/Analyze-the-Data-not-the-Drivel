This blog is still alive and kicking. I post when I post. Currently, my
energies are deployed on other fronts. If you absolutely must get your
\emph{\href{https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/}{Analyze the Data not the
Drivel}} fix look over my extensive
\emph{\href{https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/}{millibloggy photo
captions}}. Here's a typical example:

\caption[The ``miraculous staircase'' in Santa Fe's Loretto Chapel.]{The ``miraculous staircase'' in Santa Fe's Loretto Chapel. After paying
your three dollar entrance fee you can enter the chapel and see the
staircase. When I was there people were milling around while a recorded
message told the breathless story of the miraculous staircase. The story
goes something like this. The chapel needed a staircase. So some nuns
prayed to the sky fairy of carpenters and low and behold a carpenter
showed up with a bag of simple tools. Over the next month this
remarkably skilled carpenter fashioned this beautiful wood staircase
using only his simple tools. Apparently he constructed the staircase
from the floor to the upper level without central supports. Even now the
staircase lacks the standard central beam of spiral staircases. The
masses were amazed! How could the staircase stand without a central
support? Surely this is the work of the divine. This is what passes for
a miracle among sky fairy believers. It's the same type of magical
thinking that invokes aliens to explain the pyramids. Just maybe the
carpenter knew what he was doing and had the technique to pull it off.
Occam's razor people: it cuts deep.}
