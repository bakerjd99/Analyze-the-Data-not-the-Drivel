Bad news philosophers, our preeminent social critic, our font of wisdom,
our modern Socrates has succumbed to the malignant Hollywood poisons of
\href{http://www.youjustmademylist.com/?p=562}{reality TV},
\href{http://www.spike.com/articles/0xugni/the-top-10-whore-rific-female-celebrities}{celebrity
whoring},
\href{http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/09/scant-improvement-in-nations.html}{financial
ennui} and \href{http://www.whitehouse.gov/}{hopeless incompetent
governance}. Given the forces arrayed against our philosopher king only
Vegas bookies on crack would favor his chances. I knew all this when I
sat down to view the latest
\href{http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi3994852377/}{Conan the

me this one request. Grant me revenge! \textbf{And if you do not listen,
then to hell with you!}}
\end{quotation}

My friends that golden Apollonic age is past! Now we must content
ourselves with
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/binge-pretend-boink/}{Eat,
Pray, Love} travesties like:

\begin{quotation}
\emph{I live, I love, I slay, I am content.}
\end{quotation}

\textbf{When did Conan the Barbarian decide to come out?}
