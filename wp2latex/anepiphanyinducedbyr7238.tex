If you're faced with undeniable evidence that Shakespeare was a racist,
would you change your opinion about the play \emph{Othello}? I'm in the
habit of asking myself such hypotheticals; it helps me clothe my
opinions in reason. Here's another one. If you learn that one of the
greatest mathematicians in history was prone to conspiracy theories as
idiotic as the most moronic twaddle slushing around the Internet today,
would you change your opinion about this mathematician's work?

My answer to both of these questions is a resounding no!

I agree with Flaubert, "The man is nothing, the work --- all."
\emph{Othello} remains a masterpiece even if we someday discover
Shakespeare subsisted on a diet of roasted black babies. Similarly,
Gödel's \emph{Incompleteness Theorem} will stand forever as a landmark
of mathematics even though its creator, as brilliantly told in the new
biography
\href{https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298400-journey-to-the-edge-of-reason}{\emph{Journey
to the Edge of Reason The Life of Kurt Gödel}}\emph{,} was prone to
inane conspiracy theories. My favorite was Gödel's expressed belief that
\emph{unknown} works of Leibniz, that supposedly anticipated
later discoveries, were being suppressed by nefarious agents of
\emph{big philosophy.}

In this Gödel, somebody that had a much higher IQ than you, (no matter
who the Hell you are), and produced some of the greatest theorems ever,
was a total nut job. Nobody is suppressing Leibniz, nor is it likely
that any of Gödel's doctors ever tried to poison him. Gödel was
simultaneously a giant of logic and the mayor of Crazy Town. Even
Shakespeare would have been impressed by the dichotomy. Clearly, this
brain thing we all have in our heads is capable of some deeply weird
shit.

\emph{Journey to the Edge of Reason} is a fabulous and fascinating book.
I enjoyed every word, but a few days after putting it aside, a niggling
little thought, an epiphany of sorts, percolated up from the bowels of
my brain. \emph{\textbf{If a genius like Gödel could not lay off
conspiracy theories what are the chances that your average Internet
imbecile will?}}

A snowball's chance in Hell comes to mind.
