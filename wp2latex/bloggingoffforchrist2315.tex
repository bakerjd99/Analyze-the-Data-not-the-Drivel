I am celebrating Christmas by combining two of my favorite things: the
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/}{programming language J} and the superb
image editor \emph{\href{http://www.dl-c.com/}{Picture Window Pro}.} The
other day the good folks at \href{http://www.dl-c.com/}{Digital Light
and Color} announced 64 bit versions of Picture Window Pro. I was
delighted. PWP is my favorite image editor. It's had 16 bit image
support since the cows came home and it simply nukes Photoshop when it
comes to flat-out crunching performance. I was afraid that the good
old-fashioned C programmers that had crafted this program were retiring:
perhaps overwhelmed by a sea of mediocre consumer oriented overpriced
sludge --- \emph{yes Photoshop Elements I'm talking about
you!} Fortunately it's not to be! 64 bit multi-core versions of PWP will
dramatically extend the lifetime of PWP for this loyal customer.

Speaking of superb good old-fashioned C programs I must give a shout out
to J. I've been busy preparing a talk for the up coming
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Community/Conference2012}{J
conference} so J has been on my mind more than usual. Still
\href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgMdz2fe0CY}{all work and no play
makes J a dull boy!} This morning I rooted around in the J bin
directories, sucked some J icons into PWP, and then twiddled
transformations to generate some Christmas J monitor wallpaper: download
and decorate at will!
