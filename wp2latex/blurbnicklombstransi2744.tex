Lomb's \href{http://www.amazon.com/Transit-Venus-Present-Nick-Lomb/dp/1615190554}{Transit
of Venus 1631 to the Present} is the best illustrated astronomy book for
general readers since Terence Dickinson and Alan Dyer's
\href{http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-backyard-astronomers-guide-terence-dickinson/1000313829}{The
Backyard Astronomer's Guide}. Everything about Lomb's book from its eye
seizing cover, rarely seen historic photographs and charming well
researched commentary is first class. \emph{Transit} is the type of work
you steal\footnote{
I've picked up a few page design ideas.
}
from and frankly, there is no better
endorsement than that. I'm not the only reader to reach this conclusion
check out
\href{http://transitofvenus.nl/wp/2011/11/03/nick-lombs-new-book/}{this}
and \href{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005Obs...125...45H}{this} and
\href{http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13013236-transit-of-venus}{this}.

When prowling our few remaining bookstores I often skip illustrated
works. Usually they're dumbed-down rehashes of familiar material but, in
\emph{Transit's} case, I learned something on my first randomly browsed
page. The chapter introduction for Venus of the South Seas reads:

\begin{quotation}
\emph{Sometimes scientific expeditions have unintended consequences. The
desirability of observing the 1769 transit from the South Seas began a
chain of events that would lead to the founding of the colony of New
South Wales by the British in January 1788. In effect, modern Australia
owes its existence to a celestial event.}
\end{quotation}

How about that history haters. I knew why astronomers cared about
transits of Venus. In 1677 Edmond Halley, of Halley's Comet fame,
described a method for calculating the astronomical unit from transit of
Venus timings. Venus is close enough to the Earth that its track over
the Sun differs for widely separated terrestrial observers. This is the
familiar parallax effect. From this small difference you can determine
the astronomical unit and if you know the astronomical unit
\href{http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/kepler.html}{Kepler's
third law} tells you the distance of every planet in the solar system.
This was a huge payoff for 17\textsuperscript{th},
18\textsuperscript{th} and early 19\textsuperscript{th} century
astronomers. This is what got
\href{http://www.captaincooksociety.com/}{Cook} out in the Pacific. It's
a great story and Lomb's telling is the best you will find.\emph{}
