I am programming in
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL\_(programming\_language)}{APL}
again after a six-year hiatus. My APL fingers are rusty but it's amazing
how deep muscle memory goes. I still know where all the beautiful APL
glyphs' hide on standard keyboards. I've programmed in almost a dozen
programming languages but I maintain warm feelings for APL because I
lost my
\href{http://www.codesqueeze.com/the-ultimate-top-25-chuck-norris-the-programmer-jokes/}{coding
virginity} to her.

APL was gentle: abstract, clean, austere and so intoxicatingly elegant.
I loved \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth\_E.\_Iverson}{Iverson
notation} and how it manifested in what remains the most beautiful
symbol set ever devised for a programming language. Blinded by passion I
overlooked APL's faults but as my ardor cooled I took notice of one
glaring APL problem that persists to this day. \emph{Displaying,
printing, emailing and now blogging with APL is a pain!} Much has
improved with the steady adoption of Unicode but even today handling APL
imposes burdens. For example, without the
\href{http://www.vector.org.uk/?area=fonts}{APL385 Unicode} font your
browser will mangle the following APL characters.

\begin{center}
\setmonofont{APL385}
\begin{verbatim}
        !*+-/<=>?\^|~¨¯×÷←↑→↓∆∇∊∘∨∩∪∵∼≠≡≢≤≥⊂⊃⊖⊢⊣⊤⊥⋄⌈⌊

\end{verbatim}
%\setmonofont{FreeMono}
%\setmonofont{Source Code Pro}
\setmonofont[Scale=MatchLowercase]{Ubuntu Mono}
\end{center}

By the way, if you have not installed APL385 Unicode I highly recommend
downloading and installing it. You can get APL385 at
\href{http://www.vector.org.uk/?area=home}{Vector}. \emph{Regrettably
installing a Unicode APL font will not fix all your APL character
problems!} In particular you cannot \emph{reliably}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Copy and paste APL code between APL vendors or between APL and other
  languages.
\item
  Typeset APL listings with ubiquitous \LaTeX\ packages like
  \href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Packages/Listings}{lstlisting}.
\item
  Post APL idioms on \href{http://twitter.com/}{Twitter}. Twitter's 140
  character limit is not such a big deal for APL.
\item
  Print on arbitrary network printers! It's the 21\textsuperscript{st}
  century yet office printers are routinely limited by parochial IT
  policies to a small set of standard fonts.
\end{enumerate}
APL'ers almost relish these irritants after all problem solving is what
APL'ers do! We don't go crying to momma; we squash whatever is annoying
us and get on with deeper problems.

Currently I am dealing with how to display APL functions on WordPress.
WordPress supports a source code highlighting plug-in based on Alex
Gorbatchev's excellent Javascript
\href{http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/}{SyntaxHighlighter}.
The WordPress plug-in produces wonderful results for
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/a-c-net-class-for-calling-j/}{well
known languages like C\#} and by defining language specific Javascript
classes you can highlight languages like APL.
\href{http://www.lescasse.com/UseAPLFromCSharpExample.aspx}{Eric
Lescasse} has done this for \href{http://www.apl2000.com/}{APL+WIN} code
so it is possible, (given Unicode APL fonts), to render highlighted web
friendly APL code. Unfortunately WordPress does not support APL
highlighting, (what a surprise), and has banned user Javascript classes
on their freebie blogs. Apparently some programmers abuse JavaScript,
(another surprise), and
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/the-real-problem-with-enterprise-software/}{uncontrolled}
Javascript'ing might endanger the WordPress business model.

This leaves the users of peculiar programming languages with a problem.
We can pester WordPress to support new languages or we can roll our own.
I am starting a campaign to get APL and J on WordPress's list of
highlighted languages and while I am waiting for official support I will
roll my own. Fortunately, highlighting code for blogs is not difficult.
The much maligned MS Word (2007 and beyond) can crank out blog happy APL
provided you have \href{http://unicode.org/faq/utf\_bom.html}{UTF-8} APL
Unicode text to format. Getting UTF-8'ed APL is the tricky bit. Some APL
systems like \href{http://www.dyalog.com/}{Dyalog} directly support
UTF-8 and others are planning to do so. APL+WIN cannot spit out UTF-8
but it's not difficult to transform APL+WIN to UTF-8. The
\href{http://aplwiki.com/AplToUnicodeII}{APL Wiki} contains some slick
APL+WIN functions to convert internal APL text to and from UTF-8.

To get a sense of why all this fuss is worthwhile consider the following
APL function taken from
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene\_McDonnell}{Eugene
McDonnell's} superb essay
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/eem/life.htm}{Life: Nasty,
Brutish, and Short}.

\setmonofont{APL385}
\begin{verbatim}
     ∇ z ← LifeKnuth ⍵;v
      v ← ⍵
      ⍵ ← ⍵ + (1 ⌽ ⍵) + ¯1 ⌽ ⍵
      ⍵ ← ⍵ + (1 ⊖ ⍵) + ¯1 ⊖ ⍵
      ⍵ ← ⍵ + ⍵ – v
      z ← ⍵ ∊ 5 6 7
     ∇
\end{verbatim}
%\setmonofont{FreeMono}
%\setmonofont{Source Code Pro}
\setmonofont[Scale=MatchLowercase]{Ubuntu Mono}

This little function is not the \emph{shortest} APL Life function but in
my opinion it's the clearest and most concise description of Life's
generation rules out there.
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm}{Tool of thought} is not
an empty APL marketing slogan. It's the real deal!
