This was a pleasant surprise. A few weeks ago, I noticed this little
message on my \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99}{main GitHub page}.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Arctic Code Vault Contributor}

Curious, I hovered on the text and learned that a few of my open-source
repositories --- \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod}{JOD in
particular} --- had been archived in
\href{https://github.blog/2020-07-16-github-archive-program-the-journey-of-the-worlds-open-source-code-to-the-arctic/}{GitHub's
Arctic Code Vault}.

\emph{That sounded literally cool!}

The arctic code repository is what you would expect. Open-source code is
being preserved on
\href{https://www.piql.com/githubs-code-now-stored-forever-on-piqlfilm/}{silver-halide
film} in the form of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code}{QR
codes} deep in the permafrost of a decommissioned coal mine on Svalbard
in the Norwegian arctic. The source code archive is close to the
\href{https://www.seedvault.no/}{global seed bank}; both archives have
been set up to preserve code and seeds for future generations.

Readers of this blog will be familiar with my
\href{https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2010/12/06/soon-we-will-all-be-software-archeologists/}{recurring
rants} about the outrageously short lifetimes of digital media. We are
constantly told that \emph{once it's on the Internet it's there
forever.} The idea that information is safely stored on the Internet is
pure dangerous bullshit. If things are so permanent explain link rot,
site closures, file purges, censorship, copyright takedowns, account
deletions, and all the other ``slings and arrows'' online content
suffers. The Internet is a giant ephemeral froth: always bubbling,
always changing, never constant; it wasn't built to last, and it
doesn't.

Fortunately, many people and organizations are aware of the
\emph{digital archive problem}, and some, like the
\href{http://longnow.org/}{Long Now Foundation} and the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive}{Internet Archive},
were involved in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault project. The Arctic Code
Vault is only one of many planned archives. The archivists are employing
the LOCKSS, (lots of copies keep stuff safe), philosophy and plan on
storing archives in many formats in many locations. The most ambitious
projects envision off-planet stores. \emph{SpaceX} has already launched
copies of
\href{https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/the-special-data-device-spacexs-falcon-heavy-sent-to-orbit-is-just-the-start/}{Asimov's
\emph{Foundation} novels into space} where they will be safe from
\href{https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/06/27/think_the_cancel_mobs_cant_get_any_worse_think_again.html}{culture
canceling mobs} for the foreseeable future.

And, just to make things absolutely clear, the biggest threat to all
archival projects is the mob. No matter how permanent your work
motivated mobs may destroy it. Mount Rushmore and the nearby
\href{https://crazyhorsememorial.org/}{Crazy Horse} monument are
gigantic sculptures carved into hard granite on geologically stable
mountains. Left alone their faces will endure for tens of thousands of
years. \textbf{They won't be left alone!} There are already bitter
seething little basement Marxists calling for Rushmore's destruction. In
2020 attempts to destroy Rushmore will land you in prison. Will the same
hold in 2220, or 3020? You honestly cannot say.

If you want something to last for millennia it must be replicated and
hidden. Saving open source code on stable film rolls and stashing them
on a hard to get to island in the high arctic is a good first step but
like Long Now's
\href{http://www.10000yearclock.net/learnmore.html}{10,000 Year Clock}
project the mere fame of these endeavors endangers their long-term
survival. Never underestimate the viciousness of hate-driven mobs.

We cannot control the future but we can make it hard for future
generations to forget us. That's why it's absolutely essential to create
a low cost, highly durable, and compact means of archiving large volumes
of digital data. If we all cached billions of digital archives all over,
and off the Earth, the memory holing mobs of the future will be left
with a monumental task to silence us.
