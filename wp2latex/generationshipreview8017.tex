\end{floatingfigure} I grew up reading hard science fiction. Some of my favorite authors were
Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Larry
Niven, Frank Herbert, and Jerry Pournelle. All these writers created
technically plausible stories with heavy doses of science. I've always
held that science fiction needs some \emph{actual science} to
distinguish it from fantasy. As the genre matured or degenerated,
depending on your viewpoint. The requirement for legitimate science was
relaxed. It started with rebranding science fiction as \emph{speculative
fiction}. Speculative fiction is mostly fantasy written by authors who
are either hostile or indifferent to science. However you label it, the
best science fiction is magnificent. Orwell's \emph{1984} is so great
that the \emph{effete literati} no longer consider it a lowly sci-fi
novel. It's beyond that. How we classify great stories is irrelevant;
they're great stories.

Sadly, for the not-so-great stories, genre matters. This is why
bookstores sort their contents into handy customer-friendly categories
like Young Adult, Manga, Fantasy, Non-fiction, etc. Young Adult readers
are looking for a particular story; they don't want to waste their time
and money on book-nag-recommended material. Book nags have been around
for eons. If you were chastised as a child for reading comic books, you
know what a book nag is. No matter your reading tastes, book nags will deem
 whatever you read low-brow, time-wasting,
brain-rotting drivel. I don't know what book nags read. It's certainly
not graphic novels, westerns, romances, mysteries, how-to-manuals, or
anything that might entertain or inform. My advice is to ignore book
nags and read what you like, and I like a good dose of hard sci-fi now
and then.

My problem, and probably yours, is finding hard, plausible sci-fi in
today's market. Science fiction has changed in recent decades, and not
for the better! Nowadays, it is far more important for alleged sci-fi
novels to have diverse characters and authors than, you know, good
stories. Just sample contemporary book cover blurbs. They're likely to
go on about how the author is gay, black, or trans and how they bravely
manifest their truth in their stories. I'm pretty sure Clarke was not
manifesting his truth when he wrote
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Rendezvous-Rama-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0553287893}{\emph{Rendezvous
with Rama}}. He was telling a great story, and frankly, you could
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJDcCcANnU}{put a gay chick in}
\emph{Rama,} and it would still be a great story. On the other hand, if
you replaced the gay and trans characters with normies in many \emph{au
courant} sci-fi novels, you would seldom be left with a great, or even
readable, story. Chick substitution does not go both ways.

And that brings me to Michael Mammay's
\href{https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63876699-generation-ship}{\emph{Generation
Ship}} (GS). I hesitated when I spotted \emph{Generation Ship} in our
local \emph{Barnes and Noble}. I liked the straightforward,
nonpretentious title and the subdued cover art, but I was put off by the
preamble blurbs that described GS as a riveting, hard sci-fi political
page-turner. Anything political is toxic these days. It's bad enough
that I must endure orange morons and demented presidential imbeciles in
real life. I don't want them in my fiction unless they are dying
horrific, torturous deaths. I read a few pages of GS in the store, and
then I bravely (do we ever do anything that isn't brave?) decided to
risk it. I'm glad I did. \emph{Generation Ship} is a riveting
political page-turner, And here's the kicker: the book would be worse
without the politics.

\emph{Generation Ship} is about a giant spaceship on a 2Â½ century-long
interstellar voyage to a potentially habitable planet spotted by
enormous Sol/Earth system telescopes. Everyone onboard GS was born on
the ship, and the original crew has long since died. At least three
generations have lived and died on the ship, hence the name generation
ship. At this point in the story, the sci-fi is grade-A hard. There are
no magic wormholes, faster-than-light engines, cryogenic hibernation
pods, antimatter drives, and so on, except for the working fusion
propulsion powering the ship; we know how to build a GS right now. Good
sci-fi extrapolates actual science. Forecasting fusion propulsion is a
leap but a rational one. Wielding wormholes is magical thinking.

The story begins with the ship approaching its long-targeted
destination. The author uses the day-by-day arrival countdown to drive
the story. The shock of arrival triggers widespread reappraisals of the
ship's many rules and norms. For over two centuries, the inhabitants of
GS have lived and died by a rigid set of rules designed to keep the crew and 
ship smoothly functioning in a severely
resource-constrained and deadly situation. Among the many laws we might
object to is the requirement that crew members voluntarily euthanize
themselves at seventy-five years of age. It sounds harsh, but let's face
it. Seventy-five-year-olds are usually resource deadbeats; they consume
more than they produce. This is true even back on real Earth: consider
Biden and Trump -- yeah, that seventy-five-year age limit isn't looking
so bad, eh?

The GS story kicks into high gear when one seventy-five-year-old woman
decides it's unfair and unjust to self-euthanize with arrival just
months away. Why can't I live to see the planet I have spent an entire
lifetime attempting to reach? Besides, the rules \emph{are for travel
between stars}; they must change when the trip ends. I'm going to stop
here. Ruining good books should net you prison time, and
\emph{Generation Ship} is excellent hard sci-fi: enthusiastically
recommended.
