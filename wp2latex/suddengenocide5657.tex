If genocide is sudden, painless, unexpected, complete and absolute, if a
people simply vanish without screams, without fear, without
\emph{anticipation}, if one nanosecond they are and the next nanosecond
they \emph{are not}, and if somehow you are responsible, are you a war
criminal or a savior? Ultimately we all vanish, usually with screams,
usually with fear, usually with anticipation. For years I've longed for
a sudden painless death: a \emph{dismembering} that tears me apart
faster than my nerves can relay pain. Imagine such an end for all of us
-- at once -- now. \emph{Why linger?} We will go extinct. There will be
a last human. And if the last human dies with screams, with fear, with
anticipation how is that better than sudden genocide?
