My blood moon photography didn't turn out because I didn't. Come
midnight fatigue, familiarity and spotty weather conspired to send this
exhausted W2\footnote{
W2 is a basic IRS tax form in the United State. I calculate my
taxes by hand. I sometimes do the arithmetic on paper just to increase
the pain and rage. Taxation should hurt and in my case it does. Taxes
are by far the largest ``line item'' in my budget, but what the heck,
lesbians on welfare need free birth control.
}
drone to bed. It's just as well; if you're not
doing consider sleeping. In six months I'll get another shot at
photographing a blood moon. For the nonce, I'll muse on menstrual moon
madness. Exactly what Earth shaking event does this terrible tetrad
foretell?

But now, in the blood moon discharge, it's clear a fate worse than
community organizers awaits a pummeled public. Behold, \emph{Pussydent
Hildabeast},\footnote{

Hildabeast is Hillary Clinton.
