The other day while torturing myself with CNN I heard
\href{http://waxman.house.gov/}{Henry Waxman}, that living argument for
congressional term limits, tell us that the new, all singing and
dancing, US health care bill would not fund abortions or pick up the tab
for illegal immigrants. Maybe Henry is telling the truth, hey it could
happen, pigs can fly if they're dropped high enough, but I suspect Henry
is confused about laws and suggestions.

\emph{Laws} come in many forms and flavors but all laws mathematical,
scientific and legal have a common trait: \emph{enforcement}.
Mathematical laws, theorems if you will, are self enforcing. If you
accept the fundamentals or axioms of a theory and adhere to clear
logical rules of inference you don't have a choice about accepting valid
results or proofs. A sure sign of \emph{crankhood} is the steadfast
refusal to accept mathematical results. To this day we still run into
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring\_the\_circle}{circle
squarers}. They're a dying breed and I find their insanity kind of cute.
If only $\pi$ was an
\href{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html}{algebraic
number} there would be hope but fortunately it's
\href{http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/Pickover/trans.html}{transcendental} and
there isn't. Even the FSM, (\href{http://www.venganza.org/}{Flying
Spaghetti Monster} --- or God for you fundamentalists), cannot square
the circle with a straight edge and compass; it's an absolute
impossibility. Mathematical laws are not
\href{http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559749/Girly-men-are-perfect-partners-say-women.html}{girly
men}. They're tough enough for any neighborhood and won't back down even
for deities.

Scientific laws also police themselves. You aren't going to build a
perpetual motion machine, get colder than absolute zero, force mass
faster than the speed of light or convince a stubborn coin that its past
has any bearing on the next toss. Nature is a tough cop and she isn't
going to take crap from anyone. Mathematical and scientific laws are
called laws because you are forced to obey. Law and enforcement is
symmetrical; you don't get one without the other.

When we enter the legal domain this symmetry breaks down.
\textbf{Legislatures, parliaments and dictators can pass any law they
want but unless they enforce it it's not a law; it's a
\emph{suggestion}.} Have you ever driven down the freeway at the speed
limit and watched all the cars, even the ones driven by little old
ladies, zip past you? Are all these drivers breaking the law? In some
looney legal universe yes; in the real one they are \emph{ignoring the
suggested speed limit.} \emph{Without cops there are no speeders!}

As a matter of personal policy I ignore all \emph{legal} suggestions. I
only obey enforced laws. Without parking tickets I would always park in
the handicapped spots; they're more convenient. Without the IRS I
wouldn't pay a dime of taxes. Without prisons I would steal with
impunity. I'm not a bad person just an honest one. \emph{Human
legalities only become law when enforced.} Now Henry's health bill may
contain verbiage forbidding payments for abortions and illegals but
unless they're is a corresponding, rigorous and funded enforcement
regime to insure that Henry's suggestions become laws he's just spouting
bullshit.
