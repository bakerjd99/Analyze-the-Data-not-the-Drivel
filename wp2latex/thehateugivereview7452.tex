\end{floatingfigure}  I picked up \emph{The Hate U Give, (THUG)} because it was mentioned in a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gcfi-0vPAM}{TopTenz banned books} YouTube 
video. If you watch the video, you'll see that
many great books and authors have been \emph{recently} banned. George
Orwell, Joseph Heller, Ray Bradbury, J. D. Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut, and
James Joyce, for Christ sake, were all featured in the video. Ahh, to be
banned in such august company, ``I gotta read this book.'' So I marched
over to the library and checked it
out.\footnote{Oddly, \emph{THUG} has not been banned in redneck Idaho. Did the
  memory-holers screw up?}

Now I'm a nearly seventy-year-old white guy with a penchant for serious
nonfiction, so YA books are not my bag. If \emph{THUG} hadn't been
banned, I wouldn't have read it, but it was, and I did, and I am happy
to report that I enjoyed \emph{The Hate U Give.} I think we can all
agree this is no \emph{1984} or \emph{Catch-22} or \emph{Ulysses}, and I
suspect even the author would agree, but things don't have to be great
to be good, and \emph{THUG} is a good, but not great, book.

Yes, there is absolutely nothing ban worthy here. In fact, there is
nothing we haven't all seen, over and over again, on the news. If you're
looking for salacious censor-worthy content \emph{THUG} will be a
crushing disappointment. Do the imbeciles that ban books ever read them?

Based on the many long and overwrought five-star reviews young readers
have posted on
\href{https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58651625-the-hate-u-give}{Goodreads},
\emph{THUG} clearly got under people's skins. The people that love it,
love it too much. The people that hate it, hate it too much. Going
emotionally overboard is part of being young. Enjoy it! It won't last. I
neither loved nor hated \emph{THUG.} It was \emph{THUG}'s \emph{voice}
that I found most appealing. The story is told entirely from the young
protagonist's point of view, and the author never deviates from the
first person. The dialogue is clippy, and the hood grammar, or lack
thereof, takes a few pages to absorb, but it works! The characters come
alive with distinct and memorable voices. You get to know them, and
that's a sign of good writing.

Now it's true, as others have noted, that the story is predictable and
that no great lessons are imparted. We discover that racism is bad, that
discrimination is bad, that police brutality is bad, that poverty is
bad; \emph{who knew}? I don't think reiterating banalities was the
author's intent. She wanted us to get to know some interesting people,
and in that she admirably succeeded.
