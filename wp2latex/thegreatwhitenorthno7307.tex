I take pride in ignoring what some perceptive individuals have labeled
the ``misleadia.'' Our garbage press spends more time pushing their
contradictory agendas than providing useful information. I monitor their
\emph{tone} but immediately consign the majority of their claims to the
\emph{almost certainly crap unless overwhelming and independently
verified} bin. But, occasionally, events force the \emph{garbage
misleadia} to actually report something important. Today, February 17,
2022, something of great importance occurred in
Canada\footnote{One of Canada's chief attractions is its relative lack of
  importance.
} %\protect\hypertarget{fnref1}{\protect\hyperlink{fn1}{\textsuperscript{1}}}.
Of course, only people with room temperature and above IQs will consider
this of great importance.

Today Canada's
\href{https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-protests-frozen-bank-accounts-1.6355396}{Finance
Minister Chrystia Freeland} announced new measures that will allow
Canadian Banks to ``temporarily'' seize bank accounts of individuals
associated with the infamous
\href{https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/trucker-protest-convoy-southwestern-ontario-1.6329118}{truck
convoy protests} that have been annoying \emph{Princess Truedope},
formerly known as Prime Minister Trudeau: aka
\href{https://www.michiganradio.org/2016-03-08/justin-trudeau-the-shiny-pony-who-became-canadas-prime-minister}{\emph{Shiny
Pony}}, for the last few weeks.

Vast amounts of \emph{misleadia} time have been devoted to the truck
protests but basically, people in Canada are fed up with feckless and
largely ineffective COVID restrictions and want to get back to their
lives. If lock-downs, mask mandates, school closures, social distancing,
sending people home, and so-fucking-on, had actually ``crushed the
curve'' the public might be in a better mood but the simple fact is they
did not. We have run a worldwide experiment and jurisdictions that did
little or nothing about COVID did not fare much worse than those that
imposed the most severe restrictions. Most COVID deaths, based on simple
body counts, have been old obese male porkers. In the US, the
\emph{statistically typical} COVID casualty is an old fat unvaccinated
white guy with multiple comorbidities that probably voted for Trump.
Yes, the \emph{misleadia} pretends to care about COVID culling
\emph{trumpy porkers} but in their dark stupid souls, they celebrate
every death. And, why not, every porker struck from the Medicare and
Social Security roles saves money that can be better wasted on
progressive
\emph{woke-works}\footnote{\emph{Woke-works} are are projects that always require other people's
  money. ``Wokies'' (woke-people) never spend their own money. Only
  chumps put their money where their mouth
  is!} %\protect\hypertarget{fnref2}{\protect\hyperlink{fn2}{\textsuperscript{2}}}.

And that brings us to what happened in Canada. The government has
basically implemented a politically motivated
\href{https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/capital-controls/}{Capital
Control} scheme. If the Canadian government doesn't approve of your
political donations they can now legally seize your bank accounts. It's
like a Canadian version of the despicable US Patriot Act, ehh! I found
it interesting that Freeland regrets this action; she damn well should,
because the message Canada is sending the world is crystal fucking
clear: \textbf{YOUR MONEY IS NO LONGER SAFE IN CANADA!}

If you're looking for a country to park money in, scratch Canada off the
list. If you have significant assets and holdings in Canada I'd start
the process of discreetly moving them elsewhere. Capital Controls are
pure bureaucratic tyranny.

The truck protests and COVID will soon be over but this idiotic Canadian
law will persist for decades. Given the Trudeau family tradition of
declaring national emergencies over political inconveniences, the first
Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act because of one dead body, prior
Prime Ministers needed World Wars, and now princess has surpassed dead
old dad by essentially invoking martial law over illegal 18 wheeler
parking. Do you really want your money subject to nonentities like
Trudeau? Unfortunately, Canada has a nasty authoritarian streak. It's
not something we like to show in public but push a little and it emerges
with alacrity.

You've been warned!
