I'm gearing up for two big eminent celestial events. On May
20\textsuperscript{th} I'll be near Page Arizona observing an annular
eclipse of the Sun and on June 5\textsuperscript{th}, weather
permitting, I'll be in St. Louis watching Venus creep on the disc of the
Sun for the last time in my lifetime.

Eclipses and transits are spectacular events for amateur astronomers and
innocent bystanders. Of the two eclipses offer the greater spectacle. In
fact, for sheer unbridled \emph{awesomeness,} it's hard to beat a total
eclipse of the Sun! You can add up all the World Cups and Super Bowls
ever played and they would barely register on the logarithmic total
solar eclipse spectacle scale.
\href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/Trips/Overseas/Zambia-Eclipse-Trip-1/7415645\_k65QRs}{The
one total solar eclipse I saw} easily ranks as the greatest thing I've
ever seen and I'm including the births of my children. The May
20\textsuperscript{th} solar eclipse is annular so it's not in the same
galaxy as a total but annular's have their charms. At maximum eclipse
the Sun appears like a perfect blazing ring of light. In Page it will be
10 degrees above the north-western horizon: a good altitude for
composing solar landscape pictures.

By comparison the June 5\textsuperscript{th} transit of Venus will not
be a big show. Without proper equipment you won't be able to see it at
all. During transit Venus looks like a little black dot on the Sun. The
best way to see this event is with telescope or binocular projection.
\textbf{Under no circumstances should you look directly at the Sun
without proper eye protection!} For safe transit viewing techniques look
\href{http://www.mreclipse.com/Totality/TotalityCh11.html}{here}. In
2004 I used binocular projection to view the last transit of Venus from
Ottawa Canada. Transits of Venus come in pairs, eight year apart,
followed by over a century before the next pair. After 2012 you will
have to wait until 2117 to see another transit of Venus. This is our
last chance people. Yeah mortality seriously blows.
