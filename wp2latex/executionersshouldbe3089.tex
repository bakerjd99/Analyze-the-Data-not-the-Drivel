\href{http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-goldberg-death-penalty-20120730,0,6792851.story}{his
recent column} about how the media always exploits shooting sprees to
push for gun control but seldom asks --- \emph{what should we do with
mass murders?} To my right-wingy, death-beasty, vengeance-seeking,
cowboy mind
\href{http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/james-holmes-expected-to-be-charged-monday-in-colorado-massacre/2012/07/30/gJQAFCRQKX\_story.html}{James
Holmes}, the Colorado Dark Knight Rises cinema shooter, is a perfect
candidate for the death penalty. Let's review the facts.
\captionsetup[floatingfigure]{labelformat=empty}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Is James guilty beyond any reasonable doubt?} Hell fucking yes!
  There is absolutely no doubt this little shithead is guiltier than
  sin. He is so fucking guilty that even a battalion of lawyers couldn't
  prove otherwise.
\item
  \textbf{Is James mentally competent?} Here tiny lawyer brains will
  attempt to argue that poor little James is obviously mentally ill
  because he killed all those innocent people and only mentally ill
  people kill people. It's tautological drivel like this that's
  destroyed whatever esteem lawyers once had. It's a pathetic argument
  but let's play anyway. Was Caesar mentally ill when he came saw and
  conquered? Was Truman mentally ill when he decided to nuke Hiroshima?
  I hold that choosing to kill any number of people, either directly or
  indirectly, is not, ipso facto, proof of mental illness. We don't live
  in a
  \href{http://www.thespoof.com/news/spoof.cfm?headline=s2i89689}{Kumbaya} universe
  people! Sometimes there are excellent reasons for killing people and,
  more often than not, murders know exactly what they are doing.
  James is mentally competent. He carefully, logically and
  methodically executed his murderous spree.
\item
  \textbf{Was the act premeditated?} Duh --- you don't booby trap your
  apartment or stockpile ammo by accident!
\end{enumerate}
James scored a perfect trifecta; he's absolutely guilty, he knew what he
was doing and he carefully planned his murders. Colorado is a death
penalty state. \emph{If James retires to a life of cable TV in prison
that will be a miscarriage of justice!}


Coloradoans shouldn't worry another nanosecond about the fate of this
piece-of-shit. They should be lining up to execute him which brings me
to my one problem with the death penalty. If you are unable to kill
someone you shouldn't expect others to do it for you. Our
current system of \emph{humane execution,} (talk about oxymoronic
bullshit), by professional executioners is absurd. It shields society
from the consequences of their laws and beliefs and it grants to much
power to the state. Life and death belongs in the people's hands. We
should select executioners like we select jurors. Maybe if we had to
pull the trigger, throw the switch, or swing the head removing axe
ourselves we might decide we don't like the death penalty. I know many
death penalty opponents think that's the case but it's also possible
that we might like it even more. I could easily bludgeon poor James to
death hence I can abide the death
penalty. Can You?
