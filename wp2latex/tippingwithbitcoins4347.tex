For the last two days my elderly laptop has struggled with
the \href{http://bitcoin.org/en/download}{bitcoin-qt} client while it
downloaded and checked the entire Bitcoin block chain. This is one of
the fascinating things about this ``currency.'' Its entire global
transaction history is public. It occurred to me that the Bitcoin
economy is now large enough to verify basic macro economic equations.
You can~precisely calculate the ``velocity of money'' from Bitcoin
blocks.

Now that I have synchronized with the Bitcoin network all I need is some
coin to play with. If you would like to send me a few micro Bitcoins I
will send them right back. I want to observe the transfer process.
Please use this address. Think of it as a blog tip jar.
