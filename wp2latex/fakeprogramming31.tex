I have been a \emph{fake programmer} for a long time. A fake programmer
is someone who writes software to crush personal irritants. Fake
programmers are not hackers; they don't enjoy the process of software
creation; they don't work for
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Man} {the man} and they make piss
poor cubicle dwellers. Fake programmers detest industry standards and
will wage silent, passive aggressive, war on anyone foolish enough to
insist on them. The typical fake programmer is boiling with rage,
\emph{``what do you mean there's nothing out there that solves my
problem!"} When confronted with nasty problems fake programmers will:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Look for ways to ignore them
\item
  Try to pass the buck
\item
  Live with suboptimal crap
\item
  Whine
\item
  Complain about lesbians on welfare
\item
  Yell at morons on TV
\item
  Write snarky blog posts
\end{enumerate}
and if all else fails: \textbf{write some damn software}.

By the time the fake programmer has decided to code he is looking for
the quickest and least painful solution to his problem. Remember the
fake programmer doesn't care about your problems and won't live by your
rules. He only wants to kill his problem and get his blood pressure back
to normal.

Fake programmers will use industry standard languages and tools if they
provide the quickest fix. Of course this is rarely the case. At this
point fake and \emph{real} programmers diverge. Real programmers will
stick to their standard software guns and plod along. The fake
programmer says screw that; let's stake out this vampire!

I recently drove a stake through the --- ``no decent
\href{http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/products/cognos-8-planning/}{IBM/Cognos
Planning} model diagram tool'' --- vampire. In my day job I wrestle with
financial planning software. Corporate planning software is an
\emph{irritant rich} environment. My biggest complaint was the lack of an
automatic way to quickly and accurately outline the contents of a Cognos
model. Without such a guide you will be at the mercy of
``documentation'', (don't make me laugh) , or worse, Cognos Planning's
\href{http://www.buigallery.com/}{ultra-sucky user interface}. Either
way you can kiss your weekends good bye.

Fortunately, I am an excellent fake J programmer.
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/}{J is my favorite programming language}.
What's J you ask? You have never heard of it and that's to bad for you!
You have deprived your brain of a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth\_E.\_Iverson}{tool of
thought} and my human side feels for you: of course the outer fake
programmer doesn't give a rat's ass. Using
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/graphics/graphviz}{J's
excellent graphviz addon} I can generate two Cognos Planning
\emph{\href{http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/csv}{*.csv}} files
containing model metadata and then apply my
\emph{\href{http://www.box.net/shared/7mqg9bek5x}{analystgraphs}} script
to generate accurate, blood pressure reducing, diagrams like:

If you are interested in these diagrams feel free to download and use my
J scripts. Of course you will have to learn enough J to run them.
