One of my pet peeves is the ridiculously short lifetimes of digital
media. I remember 9 track mainframe tapes and 5.5 inch floppies:
technologies that thrived in an ancient bygone epoch known as the
\href{http://www.google.com/images?hl=en\&q=the+eighties\&um=1\&ie=UTF-8\&source=univ\&ei=LrgCTfL1A4fEnAesmuTlDQ\&sa=X\&oi=image\_result\_group\&ct=title\&resnum=1\&ved=0CCkQsAQwAA\&biw=888\&bih=495}{Eighties}.
Good luck trying to read 9 track tapes or 5.5 inch floppies today! You
will have better luck with older
\href{http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102688725}{paper
punch cards}. Punch card readers are hard to find these days but
\emph{you can see the damn card holes with your own eyes!} In fact you
don't even need eyes to read punch cards. I once knew a blind mainframe
programmer that banged out massive
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran}{FORTRAN} programs by feeling
the holes on punch cards. Try that with a USB flash drive.

Of course I appreciate that you can stuff the data from an entire filing
cabinet of 5.5 inch floppies onto one modern USB flash drive but I am
\emph{disturbed} by the fact that all those gigabytes will soon be
\emph{more unreadable than
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform\_script}{cuneiform}}. I am
not the first to worry about our distressed digital data.
\href{http://kk.org/}{Kevin Kelly} considers the word ``storage'' a
dangerous misnomer and advocates the use of
``\href{http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/12/movage.php}{movage}''
instead. \emph{You had better move your data from old to new formats or
you will lose it!}

\end{floatingfigure}Movage is one of the reasons I have not jumped on the
\emph{eReader} bandwagon. Replacing myriagrams of books with one
lightweight tablet is appealing but \textbf{iPads and Kindles are not
stable!} High quality
\href{http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3696333.stm}{books have
shelf lives measured in centuries}. With digital media you're lucky to
get through a decade. It's a good bet you won't be able to read what's
on your \emph{eReaders} in ten short years! You poor dumb suckers will
have to repurchase your library just like you repurchased your record
and movie collections. It's not in Amazon's or Apple's interest to worry
too much about media durability. Fortunately some people do worry about
media stability. Check out
\href{http://www.rosettaproject.org/disk/concept/}{The Long Now's
Rosetta project} for what I consider a stable medium.

To belabor this point, while I was unpacking boxes of old-fashioned
books, (we recently moved again), I came across a notebook I put
together for a poster I presented at the
\href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/190271}{\emph{1994 APL conference in
Antwerp}}. My notebook contained a paper version, \emph{still eminently
readable}, and four 3.5 inch disks. My oldest computer has a vestigial
3.5 inch disk drive so I tried copying these sixteen year old disks.
Some of the disks were unreadable, (surprise surprise), but I was able
to recover a directory containing my poster's source. Some of these
files were old Microsoft Word documents. Word 2007 could not read them!
Even when bits survive changes in software can render them useless.
Fortunately I loathed Word in 1994, a sentiment I still maintain, and
wrote my poster in \LaTeX.

\LaTeX\ source is dull ASCII text. Civilization will collapse
before we lose the ability to read it! Of course \LaTeX, like
Word, has changed since 1994 so,
\href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK9sO7Cjy-8}{just for the hell of
it}, I decided to compile this old document with
\href{http://miktex.org/}{MikTeK 2.9}. It didn't compile; I was missing
some old graphics macros and a key style file. It didn't take me long to
fix these problems. I replaced the graphics macros with standard
\verb|\includegraphics{}| commands and converted all the
Windows \href{http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/bmp}{\texttt{*.bmp}} files to
\href{http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/png}{\texttt{*.png}} files. Google even
found the long-lost missing style file \texttt{qqaaelba.sty}
in \href{http://arxmliv.kwarc.info/}{arxmliv}. After making these
trivial changes \texttt{pdflatex.exe} gobbled my poster source and moved
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/joddoc/blob/master/history/JDICT.pdf}{\emph{Using
FoxPro and DDE to Store J Words}} into the 21\textsuperscript{st} century.
