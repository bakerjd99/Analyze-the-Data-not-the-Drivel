\end{floatingfigure} There
is nothing like being right to make an impression. After calling the
\href{http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/nate-silver-obama-reelection\_n\_2086556.html}{majority
of congressional districts} in the 2012 US election
\href{http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/}{Nate Silver} enjoyed
his 15 minutes of fame. Before his election prediction I was only dimly
aware of Nate Silver. I knew he worked for the New York Times, but
that's no longer an indicator of excellence or even sanity. Heck, even
Nobel Prizes no longer guarantee excellence or sanity. Obama, vain
narcissist that he is, was
\href{http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703746604574463171820234630.html}{embarrassed}
by the dolts on the Nobel Peace Prize committee that confused existence
for accomplishment.

It wasn't Silver's employer that led me to his book; it was \emph{his
stint as a serious poker player} that told me he wasn't a standard NYT
brain-dead progressive. \textbf{\emph{Progressives do not bet with their
own money!}} They bet with other people's money. Anyone that puts
\emph{their money where their mouth is} is worth a hearing and Silver is
worth a hearing

\emph{The Signal and the Noise} is a series of essays about making
predictions. It won't surprise anyone to learn that some fields suffer
poor, dare I say idiotic, predictors. Economists and partisan policy
wonks are among the worst. Silver's statistics show many of these people
are clueless ideologues or cynical liars. They're not even reliable
contra-indicators. If only Nancy Pelosi, that Botox saturated crone, was
consistently wrong, rather than randomly moronic, we might profit from
her emissions.

As bad as some predictors are it's not all bleak. Meteorologists have
dramatically improved their forecasts. A few decades ago it was anyone's
guess where hurricanes would hit land. Now it's possible to forecast
landfalls~within a hundred miles two days in advance. The weather
service called Katrina before it hit New Orleans. It's too bad so many
ignored the warning.

One of the best sections in \emph{The Signal and the Noise}~deals with
the dangers of ``over-fitting'', over-fitting occurs when a model ends
up modeling noise instead of signal. Over-fitting is an egregious
statistical error but human beings are evolved over-fitters. If you
``predict'' the wind is shaking a bush and it's a tiger you're cat food.
If you predict a tiger is shaking a bush and it's the wind you have a
bad hair day. Evolution favors the latter. If life is short, nasty and
brutish, it pays to over-fit immediate dangers. This is not the case
when over-fitting tells you something is highly unlikely when it isn't.

Silver makes a good case for the
\href{http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Safety-and-Security/Safety-of-Plants/Fukushima-Accident-2011/\#.UVOeghfBOSo}{Fukushima} nuclear
disaster going down in history as a classic case of the dangers of
over-fitting. Earthquakes are currently unpredictable. Silver goes over
the history of earthquake prediction and it's sobering. Forecasts made
by 21\textsuperscript{st} century geophysicists, armed with petaflop
supercomputers, are only marginally better than simple historical means.
This is a tough scientific problem made orders of magnitude harder by
the difficulty of collecting data. We cannot directly measure stresses
twenty kilometers underground. Hence the data feeding earthquake models
are~\emph{at best} approximate and incomplete. This is unfortunate
because models based on sketchy data are essentially conspiracy theories
without black helicopters. You won't find many geophysicists making
short-term Vegas bets on the output of their earthquake models.

\label{fig:3901X2}
\end{floatingfigure} This doesn't mean that earthquakes are random or lack order. Earthquakes
are remarkably orderly over geological timescales. They
\href{http://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl.1/2509.full}{eerily fit a
power-law distribution}. This excellent fit makes it possible to pick
any point on the Earth and compute an earthquake probability. Such
probabilities were computed for the seas near Fukushima but the
earthquake model used was over-fitted and it dramatically underestimated
the likelihood of magnitude 9 earthquakes. The Fukushima model
had been ``tweaked'' to echo the fact that \emph{rare} magnitude 9
earthquakes had not been observed near Japan in
centuries.  Instead of following a nice linear log-log plot the
Fukushima plot was ``bent'' and the bend led to the assumption that
it wasn't necessary to plan for magnitude 9 earthquakes and potentially
huge tsunamis. Here model over-fitting led to seawall over-topping.
This is not your average stats 101 screw-up.

Looking back it's easy to see where people went wrong. Maybe evil crony
capitalists, bent on saving a few yen on concrete, conspired to sabotage
earthquake models before submitting low ball Fukushima seawall
bids. Doesn't~\href{http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lex\_Luthor}{Lex Luthor} do
this every other day? Here it's not necessary to invoke super-villains,
old fashioned short-term thinking, fortified with professional hubris, is
all that's required. Silver makes it abundantly clear that prediction,
``\href{http://www.larry.denenberg.com/predictions.html}{especially
about the future}'', is hard but not necessarily hopeless. This is an
excellent book for both lovers and haters of statistics.
