Dear readers, as most of you know, this blog does not promote anything
except the fevered ravings of its somewhat deranged author. But today,
in a wild break with tradition, I'm promoting my daughter's art.

Some of us put \emph{Winnie the Wuhan Kung
Flu}\footnote{If calling COVID-19 ``Winnie the Wuhan Kung Flu'' triggers you, may I
suggest expedient self-fornication. Never self-censor for simpletons.} lockdowns to good use.
I finished my \href{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M2KBMND}{JOD book}, and
my daughter Helen transformed herself into a visual artist. This collage, see Figure~\ref{fig:7147x0} on page~\pageref{fig:7147x0}, 
was built from two images she sent me from her recent Belleville Ontario
\href{https://bazaarmarket.ca/}{art show}. Helen's work is
\href{https://www.etsy.com/shop/HBBArtByHelen?ref=profile_header}{available
on ESTY}.

Know that if you purchase one of Helen's paintings, you're not only
helping her, but you're helping people struggling with depression in
Kingston Ontario and throughout Canada. Helen battled depression after
graduating from Queen's University in Kingston. She knows how crippling
it is; so she's donating 10\% of her art sales to the
\href{https://www.defeatdepression.ca/}{Kingston Defeat Depression
Campaign}.

I purchased some of her early paintings. Dads are supposed to support
their kids, but I have a feeling the paintings I bought to help her out
will turn into \emph{investments} as Helen's art matures. If Helen's art
catches your fancy and you don't see anything on her ESTY site that
suits you, \emph{she takes commissions}! Her biggest sale so far was a
large commissioned work for a Toronto art aficionado. I'm sure she would
be delighted to paint one for you!
