Blogging is like going to the gym. You tell yourself you're going to do
it everyday and then you don't. The last two months have been all about
my \href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/evelyns-eulogy/}{mother's
death} and work. Any remaining hours were siphoned off by my other
hobbies: photography and reading. Yeah I count reading as a hobby.

If we're going to have the long happy writer-reader relationship that
we're all looking for you are going to have to put up with my ticks. I
will enumerate them for you:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{I blow hot and cold on things.} I am either all in or all out.
  If I am blogging that's pretty much all I am doing. If I am taking
  pictures or programming that's pretty much it. Balance is for rocks on
  pinnacles not me.
\item
  \textbf{I always return to my passions.} I never give up on things I
  just put them aside. My affection for amateur astronomy has not gone
  away it's just difficult to indulge it in the wretched quasi-opaque
  low altitude skies of St. Louis. This city has many charms but clear
  skies is not one of them.
\item
  \textbf{I don't give a crap about what people think.} This is a
  problem for anyone that pretends to write. Authors, even lowly
  bloggers, cannot ignore their audience or they won't have one. My
  manly impulse is to ignore you, but I will, on occasion, profusely
  apologize and beg you to keep reading. It's all crocodile tears. My
  apologies are as insincere as Obama's: another guy that doesn't give a
  crap about what you think.
\item
  \textbf{I will never change: at least while alive.} Guys get this
  instantly. A few women have vainly tried to correct my bad habits;
  they didn't succeed.
\end{enumerate}

To end June on a happy note and, more importantly, to test a nifty
WordPress layout feature here's a collection of recent images.
All these images, and thousands more,
\href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/}{are always on view on
SmugMug}. Next month I will~be a better boy and write the epoch defaming
rubbish you all love and crave.
