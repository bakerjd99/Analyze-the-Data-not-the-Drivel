While going through my late mother's pictures I came across a box of my
great-grandmother Minnie's old photographs. When my great-grandmother
died in 1977 my grandmother
\href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/Grandparents-1/i-PBjmr7p/A}{Hazel}
took her pictures and stuffed them in her
\href{http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/}{Hoarder's level} junk filled
basement.\footnote{
If Hazel was alive today she would be a star on TV's Hoarders.
} After Hazel's death
\href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/The-Way-We-Were/i-Z64DmrR/A}{my
mother} recovered Minnie's pictures from Hazel's hoard and promptly
filed them with her pictures where they remained until I found them.
Minnie's pictures have already seen off three generations of my
ancestors and I'm next in line. Are they worth it?

Many of Minnie's pictures are over a hundred years old. The oldest
probably date to the 1870s or 1880s. Despite their age they're in
excellent condition. Obviously Minnie took care of her pictures and
thankfully Montana basements and attics are often high and dry. I spent
an entire day studying Minnie's pictures. Her old portraits are superb
examples of small studio 19\textsuperscript{th} and early
20\textsuperscript{th} century photography, see the following
\href{https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F3SR-Q8S}{wedding portrait},
and her snapshots are candid shots of the people she knew and loved. All
of which brings me to my current problem. \emph{I don't know who these
people are!}

I have never had much of an interest in family trees or the entire
quasi-delusional undertaking of genealogical research for the simple
reason that most of it is bullshit. \emph{The basic genealogical problem
is simple: people have always screwed around and then lied about it.}
When you get right down to it you cannot be certain, without DNA
testing, that your own parents are your biological parents. There are
good reasons to suspect that at least
\href{http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/8308/to-have-and-to-cuckold}{1\%
to 5\% of children} result from cuckolding~and for some social classes
it may be as~high as 30\%. In other words your daddy may not be who you
think it is! Cuckolding~varies with culture, time, socio-economic status
and so forth but it's rarely zero. A cuckolding rate of 5\% implies that
by the time you've traced your ancestors to the great-great-grandparent
level there is a 19\% chance that an alleged, perfectly documented,
ancestor is not really an ancestor. By the time we get back to the time
of Christ, roughly 100 generations, there's a 99.99\% chance that any
alleged ancestor is not really any ancestor. Genealogy without DNA is a
hollow dead-end.

As bad as cuckolding is it's~the least of our genealogical problems.
Genealogical records are incomplete, contain serious errors and are
often complete frauds. As late as the 19\textsuperscript{th} century the
settlement of estates was very sensitive to birth order. If you were a
first-born son you got everything while your baby brother got squat. It
was even worse for women; they got less than squat. In such an
environment there is a powerful incentive to forge records. Old
handwritten documents may look official to modern eyes but you cannot
assume they're accurate. With a well-placed bribe first-born Johnnie
suddenly disappears from the record. \emph{People have always lied about
the important things.}

Given all these obvious problems I usually ignore people going on about
the exploits of their glorious ancestors. Your roots are unreliable
people! You really don't know who your great-great-great granny was and
if you insist on telling tales about her I will insist on DNA evidence.
I know that many of the dead in Minnie's pictures are \emph{probably}
blood relatives and some are probably direct great-great or greater
grandparents. I cannot be 100\% sure they're genetic ancestors but I can
follow obvious document breadcrumbs and learn enough about these people
to attach stories to their pictures.

I wasn't looking forward to the giant chore of scanning, restoring and
researching Minnie's pictures\footnote{
Despite their good condition it was still a lot of work to restore the
images posted here. To judge what I had contend with browse this
gallery of  \href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/Themes/Manipulations/Restorations-1}{before
and after diptychs}.
}  but
following breadcrumbs was more interesting than expected. It turns out
that there's~a lot of dead people on the internet. When I started
looking for death and marriage records I immediately came across a
cemetery record for
\href{http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr\&GSln=baker\&GSfn=evelyn+\&GSmn=v\&GSbyrel=all\&GSdyrel=all\&GSst=28\&GScnty=1627\&GScntry=4\&GSob=n\&GRid=110246189\&df=all\&}{my
own recently deceased mother}. It was surprising~to find her so soon.
There's an active world-wide~ghoulish~group of people photographing
cemetery monuments and posting their findings online. It's ironic but a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find\_a\_Grave}{Facebook for the
dead} preceded the Facebook for the living. Starting with my mother I
backtracked through my alleged ancestors looking for a ``Lydia.''
~``Lydia''~was scrawled on the back of what looked like~the oldest of
Minnie's pictures.

If the records are correct I believe this ``Lydia'' is Lydia Jane Ayres.
There is a very good chance that Lydia is one of my great-great
grandmothers.
\href{https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XLPB-DF8}{Lydia married
Albert F. Raver} in 1863 in Brant Ontario. Albert was the mother of
Minnie's husband
\href{https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F3Q3-45X}{Bert Raver}.

I didn't find any pictures of Albert Raver in Minnie's collection and
that's too bad because I~suspect Albert had an eye for the babes. I
looked for his death record and found this
\href{https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MVLY-WLB}{confusing census
entry}. Here was an Albert F. Raver with exactly the same age and birth
origin remarried to a Lydia L. Raver. At first I thought it was a
mistake but Albert's marriage to Lydia L. Ayres was in 1906. That did
not compute. Then I remembered a story my grandmother Hazel told me
years ago when we were talking about her grandparents. She told me that
one of her grandfathers married twice to two women with the same first
and last names. She complained about how difficult this made sorting
Christmas and birthday cards. I cannot remember if the name was Lydia
Ayres but what are the chances? It seems Albert married~ Lydia Jane
Ayres in 1863. Somehow~they parted ways and later, at the age of 68,
Albert remarried in 1906 a younger Lydia L. Ayres. Having been divorced
and remarried myself I can only marvel at Albert's ingenuity. The last
thing you want to do in your senile dotage is call a second wife by your
first wife's name. Before social security that could have been a fatal
mistake.
\href{http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr\&GRid=89404051}{Randy
old Albert} neatly dodged that bullet.

The randiness was not confined to the Raver branch. Equally intriguing
is this old portrait of ``dad's old sweetheart.'' Here Minnie is likely
referring to her own father and my great-great granddaddy
\href{http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr\&GSln=Davis\&GSfn=Howell\&GSmn=C\&GSby=1850\&GSbyrel=after\&GSdy=1950\&GSdyrel=before\&GSst=28\&GScntry=4\&GSob=n\&GRid=67837689\&df=all\&}{Howell
Cobb Davis}. Screwing around, contrary to boomer mythology, wasn't
invented in the 1960s.

Minnie lived to 96. I was in my twenties when she died so I remember
some of the people in her snapshots. Here's Minnie with her
\href{http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr\&GRid=61581142}{first-born
son Vernon} standing in Marble Canyon Arizona in 1949. I knew~Vernon as
a boy. He always posed exactly like you see him her.

You can read the poor guys mind. ``Do you really need another picture?
Well if that's how it's going be I'm going to assume my petulant spoiled
fat boy pose.'' You cannot blame Vernon. His photographic life got off
to a dreadful start. Look at this gem.

In the early 20\textsuperscript{th} century women liked to dress up
their baby boys as girls. Vernon got the full girly treatment. You
cannot blame him for being scarred for life after such trauma. Here's a
clue ladies. Boys are not girls. Gender is not arbitrary. People that
assert the contrary are idiots.~Sorry if that sounds like
\href{http://www.policymic.com/articles/44479/mansplaining-101-how-to-discuss-politics-and-feminism-without-acting-like-a-jackass}{mansplaining};~the
truth is not always polite.

I doubt I'll ever get through Minnie's pictures. There are hundreds of
images to scan, restore and research. I just don't have the time or
energy but in the years ahead I will occasionally pick out and upload
attractive images. Here's
