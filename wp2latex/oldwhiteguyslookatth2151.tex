\end{floatingfigure}Last Friday I joined the \href{http://www.slasonline.org/}{Saint Louis
Astronomical Society} (SLAS). In the last twenty years I have been a
member of two chapters of the \href{http://www.rasc.ca/}{Royal
Astronomical Society of Canada}:
\href{http://kingston.rasc.ca/}{Kingston} and
\href{http://www.ottawa.rasc.ca/}{Ottawa}, the
\href{http://www.fortworthastro.com}{Forth Worth Astronomical Society}
in Texas, the \href{http://www.mnastro.org/}{Minnesota Astronomical
Society} in Saint Paul and the
\href{http://www.ocastronomers.org/}{Orange County Astronomers} in
southern California. No matter where I go I can see the sky and I can
find people who share my interest in it. The SLAS is very similar to
other clubs. If you were to walk into a typical astronomy club meeting
your overwhelming impression would be: \emph{old white guys like looking
at the sky!}

\emph{}The undeniable old whiteness of astronomy clubs is a concern
because it tells you something about the health of our culture. If you
think I am pulling your leg or being sarcastic consider the following.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Club members have strong \emph{noncommercial} or
  \emph{unprofessional} interests in science.} Most are not professional
  astronomers or even scientists. Few derive any income from their
  interests in astronomy and many spend insane amounts of time and money
  building telescopes, observing the sky and keeping up with findings in
  astronomy and related sciences. What's the point? Wouldn't these
  people be better off devoting the time they ``waste'' on astronomy to
  more productive pursuits? Mind you the same applies to
  \emph{unprofessional} artists and hobbyists of all types that
  ``waste'' comparable amounts of time on their own ``pointless''
  pursuits. Astronomy club members love what they do, and, in my
  experience, it's a constant and enduring love that never dims or goes
  away. Anyone with a real passion knows what I'm talking about.
\item
  \textbf{Astronomy club members respect, understand and value
  scientific arguments.} We are constantly reading depressing assessments
  of the public's dismal understanding of science. For example, 44\% of
  the US public accepts that,
  ``\href{http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev\_publia.htm}{God created
  man pretty much in his present form at one time within the last 10,000
  years.}'' Only 5\% of scientists accept this nonsense and
  \href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/hard-ass-skeptic-rules/}{even
  5\% seems to high for my skeptical ass.} Astronomy club members will
  poll more like scientists than the general public on this question. A
  society that depends on science yet harbors ignorant masses that do
  not grasp or appreciate basic scientific findings will not hold.
\item
  \textbf{Club members welcome anyone with an interest in astronomy.} I
  have belonged to half a dozen astronomy clubs and without exception
  they welcome anyone with an interest in the subject. I have never seen
  somebody turned away, or discouraged, for reasons of race, age, sex,
  sexual orientation, political or religious affiliations, or social
  class. Astronomy clubs are about as egalitarian as it gets! It gets
  better. Most clubs nurture and cherish the youngsters in their
  midst's. This is partly because we don't see a lot of youngsters and
  by youngster I mean anyone under thirty!
\end{enumerate}
So why are astronomy clubs in North America old and white? Do people
think you need expensive telescopes and other pricey gadgets to enjoy
amateur astronomy? I've looked at the sky for decades primarily with
binoculars. They are still the best way to learn the sky. Has the
public's interest in science declined during the last forty years? Is
elementary science education worse than it was when I was a child? Is
the XBox'ed and Avatar'ed generation bored with looking at faint smudges
in the sky? \emph{Finally, do we smell?} I don't know why astronomy
clubs are old and white but I do know that I will probably be associated
with one until the day I die.
