``How many authenticated ancient mathematical artifacts are known?''

I recently asked myself this question while researching the history of
mathematical proof. Ultimately, all historical theories \emph{must
answer to the evidence}. For mathematics, this means studying
\emph{surviving} parchment documents, cuneiform tablets, bamboo strips,
bone markings, Stella inscriptions, calculating boards, and other
objects, that inform our mathematical origin stories. And, when it comes
to the ancient history of mathematics, that's all we have --- stories.
Stories that are spun from \emph{a very small number} of authentic
artifacts.

``How bad is it?''

When I started tracking down references to ancient mathematical
artifacts, I quickly discovered that everyone keeps referring to the
same short list of objects. Instead of going down a rabbit hole, you
find yourself wandering in a circular maze littered with objects like
the

Elements}. Surely the
\href{https://www.amazon.com/History-Mathematical-Proof-Ancient-Traditions/dp/110701221X}{dense
convoluted tomes} going on about the history of mathematics cannot ---
when traced back to source materials --- depend on such a meager
collection: a collection so small it would fit in the bed of your pickup
with enough space left over for your dog!

Ancient authenticated mathematical artifacts are exceedingly rare. They
are among the rarest of all ancient artifacts. Figure~\ref{fig:7765x1} on page~\pageref{fig:7765x1} was
taken from
\href{https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691114859/the-mathematics-of-egypt-mesopotamia-china-india-and-islam}{\emph{The
Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam: A
Sourcebook}}; it lists all the known major Egyptian mathematical
artifacts. \emph{There are fifteen objects in this table spanning some
two thousand four-hundred years!}

\label{fig:7765x1}
\end{figure}
I think we can safely infer that our knowledge of ancient Egyptian
mathematics is woefully incomplete. The ancient Greeks, still widely
lauded for their many mathematical achievements,  left \emph{no
original documents}. Euclid's famous \emph{Elements}, a book we still
esteem and admire today, can only be traced to the Middle Ages --- almost
a thousand years after its avowed creation date. A thousand years is
plenty of rewrite time. How much of \emph{The Elements} dates to 300 BCE
and how much derives from later amendments is still hotly contested.

Some cultures are better represented in the archeological record than
others. The Mesopotamians, actually a series of cultures spanning
thousands of years, that lived in the fertile crescent, the land between
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern Iraq, wrote on cuneiform clay
tablets. When dried or baked cuneiform is very stable. Even better the
Mesopotamians recycled their tablets by using them as filling for walls.
Many thousands of these tablets have survived and are still readable
today. Because so many cuneiform tablets have survived it's possible to
apply rudimentary statistics. Of the 5000 tablets found in the late
fourth-millennium city of Urak about 10\% were ``school'' exercises.
Most of these exercises are word lists and other writing exercises but a
few exhibit calculations. We can't be certain if these tablets are
representative but they do show that ancient \emph{Urakians} had the
same aversion to mathematics that's found in modern cultures. \emph{Math
nerds have never been the cool kids!} In any case, the moral of the
story is clear; if you want your stuff read thousands of years from now,
write on durable materials.

For cultures that wrote on perishable materials like papyrus (Egyptians,
Ptolemaic Greeks), bamboo strips (China, Japan, Korea), tree bark
(India), string (Inca and Pre-Inca quipus), and fig-tree fibers (Mayan
codices), the record is extremely sparse. For example, the famous
ancient library of Alexandria supposedly held hundreds of thousands of
papyrus documents, but \emph{not a single one has survived! History is a
cruel castrating bitch!} Lack of material is a common theme: there are
no Indian manuscripts older than 200 AD. The famous Bakhshali manuscript
hints at older materials but none of its predecessors have been found.
Modern Indians make bold claims about the antiquity of their mathematics
but when it comes to hard artifacts their situation is comparable to the
ancient Greeks, another culture that left us \emph{few originals to
study}. The oldest Chinese bamboo strips date to around 200 BCE. There
are older ``oracle bone'' markings that date to Bronze Age 1200-1000 BCE
that show the ancient Chinese had developed base 10 numerals but sadly,
the bone scripts do not contain any known mathematical texts or cheat
sheets. Too bad!

The oldest known \emph{unambiguously mathematical artifact} is a
cuneiform tablet labeled
\href{https://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/artifacts/3118}{W 19408,76} that
dates to 3320 BCE. Five thousand years ago somebody was calculating
areas. There are even older objects that hint at paleolithic
mathematics. Tally sticks --- mostly notched bones like the Ishango and
\href{https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1204213109}{Lebombo}
bones --- suggest people were ``counting'' tens of thousands of years
ago. You can't infer much from tally sticks but that hasn't stopped
so-called \emph{ethnomathematicians} from
\href{https://afrolegends.com/2013/08/29/the-ishango-bone-craddle-of-mathematics/}{making
extravagant claims}. In the wilder versions, paleolithic number
theorists were contemplating prime numbers twenty thousand years ago.
It's not impossible, but as Carl Sagan famously said,
``\href{https://effectiviology.com/sagan-standard-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence/}{Extraordinary
Claims Require Extraordinary Evidence},'' and right now (2023), the data
does not align with the drivel.

And speaking of ``data'', \href{https://www.maa.org/}{The Mathematical
Association of America} maintains one of the best historical
mathematical object lists:
\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/index-to-mathematical-treasures}{The
Index to Mathematical Treasures}. This list contains roughly 1300
objects. I \emph{screen-scraped} the HTML, extracted the list, and
charitably assigned hard dates to ambivalently dated objects. For
example, the entry for the
\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-zhoubi-suanjing}{Zhoubi
suanjing} refers to a book printed in 1603 that claims descent from a
100 BCE original. So, I take 100 BCE as the date of this object. This
charitable date assignment will tend to make objects older than they
probably are. After assigning dates I computed the following
half-millennia histogram.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Count & Cumulative & Start Year & End Year \\
\midrule
\endhead
1 & 1 & -25000 & -5000 \\
1 & 2 & -4500 & -4000 \\
2 & 4 & -3000 & -2500 \\
9 & 13 & -2000 & -1500 \\
1 & 14 & -1500 & -1000 \\
7 & 21 & -500 & 0 \\
15 & 36 & 0 & 500 \\
13 & 49 & 500 & 1000 \\
111 & 160 & 1000 & 1500 \\
1142 & 1302 & 1500 & 2000 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Negative numbers refer to BCE dates, and yes, I know the \emph{Year
Zero} does not exist in our calendar. It should but that's a rant for
another day. The second column is a cumulative object count. From -25000
to 0 we have 21 objects! Remember, I am assigning charitable dates. The
actual count is even lower. The MAA treasures list is not comprehensive
but the trends it exhibits are likely to be stable as the object count
increases. \emph{The vast majority of entries date from the year 1500 to
the present and this corpus constitutes our actual history of
mathematics}. Before 1500 and movable type printing, the object count is
profoundly underrepresented and it only gets worse the further back you
go. We just don't have a lot of germane material to study. Keep this in
mind the next time some blowhard starts opining on the history of
mathematics and its subdisciplines like the history of proof.

So, the answer to my question, ``How many authenticated ancient
mathematical artifacts are known?'' is simply, \textbf{\emph{not many!}}
People are still looking and perhaps in the years to come more objects
will be found that will render our alleged mathematical histories less
mythical and more mathematical.
