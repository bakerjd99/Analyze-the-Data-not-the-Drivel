Guam?

Guam?

Kim, \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0hK1wyrrAU}{you can't be serious!} I realize you live in a self-imposed hermit
kingdom where questioning your fat headed notions results in
\href{http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/kim-jong-executed-uncle-feeding-pack-starving-dogs-article-1.1565299}{being
thrown to actual dogs} but surely you're aware of \emph{Baker's Law of
American Cluelessness.}

\medskip

\emph{No matter what the topic of conversation roughly one-third of the
American public won't have a freaking clue what you're talking about.}

\medskip

I can assure you that an embarrassingly large percentage of Americans
have no idea where, or what, Guam is and, even more disturbingly,
even if they know it's an island somewhere in the Pacific they may
think \href{http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/guamtip.asp}{it's in
danger of tipping over} if too many people stand on one end.

Let's suppose you lose your mind, (I'm being sarcastic Kim), and nuke
Guam. If we don't immediately destroy you can expect this from the
American public.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
%\tightlist
\item
  Eco-morons and Green-twits will start worrying about nuclear fallout
  drifting ashore in California and write earnest ignorant Internet
  screeds about isotopes of Iodine. Kim, as a devoted Korean hater of
  all things Japanese, I'm sure you remember the great Japanese
  earthquake and tsunami of 2011. Isn't it great when nature kills your
  enemies for free? More than 15,000 Japanese citizens died and, oh
  yeah, the tsunami also wrecked a nuclear power plant: Fukushima.
  American eco-imbeciles quickly forgot about the earthquake and the
  thousands of dead bodies scattered by the tsunami and started worrying
  about
  \href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/11/16/fukushima-radiation-in-pacific-tuna-is-equal-to-one-twentieth-of-a-banana/\#3b3cfee6fe61}{traces
  of Fukushima radiation} polluting their
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY}{pure bodily
  fluids}. If you blow up Guam these idiots will ignore your glorious
  Guam body count and start agonizing about radioactive kale and the
  impact of fallout on the transgendered.
\item
  Old school American commies, (yes Kim we still have them and they're
  even more delusional than your commies), will look past your selecting
  Guam as a target, issuing orders to attack it, and them calmly
  murdering thousands of innocents and find some way to blame a white
  capitalist guy. \emph{You see Kim, as a nonwhite Asian dude, you have
  no moral agency}. Even if you think you are making choices it's really
  just a reaction to what some white capitalist guy did to you, or your
  bat-shit crazy dad, or some distant ancestor, at some unspecified time
  in the past. \emph{Nothing is ever your fault.} This is good news for
  professional western victims but kind of tarnishes your great Asian
  conqueror image. For western commies, there are no Asian Genghis
  Khan's.
\item
  Our uniformly imbecilic \emph{fake-news-ers}, also known as the media,
  will finally have a topic worthy of 24/7 bloviating. They'll be
  thrilled that an atomic emergency might result in people watching them
  again. Of course, they'll quickly sabotage their transient relevance
  by staging talking-head-a-thons about ``proportional responses'' to
  being nuked. If a misunderstood adversary uses a forty kiloton nuke on
  your civilians is it a crime to retaliate with a megaton?
\item
  Finally, most of the American public will be deeply pissed. They'll
  cheer when a submarine pops a thermonuclear cap in your fat ass.
\end{enumerate}

Kim nuking Guam is a big suicidal mistake. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy
grand gestures and heroic deaths. Achilles didn't garner eternal glory
by coming home from the Trojan War and growing olives. I know you're
under pressure to live up to dear dead old dad and to dearer older
deader granddad. I know you feel inadequate and will never be worthy of
the aggrandizing bullshit you force feed your people. So let me help you
by selecting nuke worthy American targets. Don't misconstrue my help. If
you hit any of the following we will still exterminate you and your
comrades.

Instead of Guam consider:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
%\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Washington D.C}: I can't think of a more nuke worthy target. I
  know D.C. may be a long shot for your tiny-penis-ICBMs but if you can
  hit D.C. please have a whack. Trump's swamp draining hasn't been going
  very well. Maybe a swamp nuking would be more effective. The downside
  of nuking D.C. is that many Americans would secretly cheer it on.
  We'll appreciate the irradiated swamp but we'll still nuke you in
  return.
\item
  \textbf{Los Angeles, especially the Hollywood'ey bits}: Americans love
  their vacuous entertainments and the empty-headed narcissistic
  preening nitwits that make them. You can't imagine what a death-blow
  it would be to forego the next Marvel movie or another
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf69EEL3WBk}{ManBearPig}
  lecture. We'll miss the Hollywood Sign and the Griffith Observatory
  but eagerly look forward to next years
  \href{http://www.legacy.com/memorial-sites/oscars/}{Dead Celebrity
  Roll} at the \emph{relocated} Oscars. Oh, we'll still nuke your ass,
  even for Hollywood.
\item
  \textbf{Silicon Valley}: Recent
  \href{http://www.businessinsider.com/anti-google-ads-pop-up-outside-office-criticizing-ceo-sundar-pichai-2017-8}{Goolag'ey
  events} have many Americans wondering if the hubris infused innovators
  of Silicon Valley have lost their mojo. Detonating nukes will take
  their powerful minds off disturbing notions of gender based
  intellectual differences and focus them on finding blast proof safe
  spaces. \emph{Great minds need real problems.} Kim, about the only
  downside of nuking Silicon Valley, is that Facebook won't be able to
  tally your ``Likes.'' It sucks to be radioactive rubble. Oh, and we
  still nuke
  you.

\item
  \textbf{Portland Oregon and Seattle Washington}: Oregon and Washington
  would be relatively sane states if these tumors were excised: just
  saying. Oh, we still nuke your ass.
\end{enumerate}

Kim, you can't win but with judicious target selection, you can
\emph{make a difference}. As a wise shoe maker once said: ``Just do
it!''
