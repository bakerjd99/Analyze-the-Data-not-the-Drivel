\paragraph{There are no quick WordPress to \LaTeX\ fixes}
Over the next three posts I will describe how to convert WordPress's
\href{http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/06/12/xml-import-export/}{export
XML} to \LaTeX\ source code.

\end{floatingfigure}\noindent I know that many of you are looking for a
quick WordPress to \LaTeX\ fix; unfortunately there are no quick fixes.
The two formats come from different worlds and are used in different
ways. Producing useful \LaTeX\ source from WordPress export XML will
require manual edits. My goal here is to minimize manual edits,
produce high quality \LaTeX\ source and to \emph{outline} what you will
have to contend with. To get an idea of what you can expect download the
\href{http://www.box.com/s/eqnv3obuy0detf99nruf}{\LaTeX\ compiled version
of this post.}

\paragraph{Visual and Logical composition}

WordPress and \LaTeX\ are examples of the two basic approaches,
\emph{visual} and \emph{logical,} taken by writing software. Visual
systems value appearance. It matters what things look like and no effort
is spared to get the right look. Logical systems value content. What's
said is far more important than what it looks like. Logical systems
impose order and structure and typically defer visual elements. As you
might expect there is no such thing as a pure visual or logical writing
system. Successful systems use both approaches to a greater or lesser
degree. Composing WordPress blog posts is roughly 35\% visual and 65\%
logical.\footnote{
Actually this is not bad.
\href{http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/findsoftware/a/pagelayout.htm}{Page
layout systems} are far worse. A typical layout system might be 90\%
visual and 10\% logical making layout systems polar opposites of \LaTeX.
} \LaTeX\ composition is about 10\% visual and
90\% logical. The numbers do not line up; there is a basic mismatch
here.

\emph{Many format X to \LaTeX\ converters tackle this mismatch by
attempting to maintain visual fidelity. This is a catastrophic error
that renders the entire conversion useless.} Here's a hint. If you're
using a predominantly logical system like \LaTeX\ you don't give a
rodent's posterior about visual fidelity. This method dispenses with all
but the most basic of visual elements. No attempt is made to preserve
fonts, type sizes, image scale, justification, hyphenation, text color
and so forth. The goal is to produce working \LaTeX\ source that can be
transformed to whatever final layout the author desires.

\paragraph{Prerequisite Software}

I use two programs to transform WordPress export XML to \LaTeX\: the
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/}{J programming language} and
\href{http://johnmacfarlane.net/}{John MacFarlane's} Pandoc.
\href{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/}{Pandoc} is an excellent
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup\_language}{text mark-up} to
mark-up converter. It wisely avoids attempting to convert entire complex
documents and focuses on getting \emph{parts} of documents right. It
does a particularly good job of converting HTML to \LaTeX\ which is a
\emph{crucial} part of this process. I use Pandoc to transform the HTML
embedded in WordPress export XML
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA}{\texttt{CDATA} elements} to
\texttt{*.tex} files and I use J to preprocess and post process Pandoc
inputs and outputs and to stitch everything together into a set of \LaTeX\
ready files.

Download Pandoc from
\href{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html}{here}. I use the
Windows command line version. There are Linux and Mac versions as well.
Download J from \href{http://www.jsoftware.com/stable.htm}{here}. The
easiest J install is the 32 bit Windows J 6.02 version. Other versions
require additional steps to configure and deploy. If you are already a J
user there is no need to install a particular system but you will need:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The task library \texttt{require 'task'}
\item
  The utility program
  \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/}{\texttt{wget.exe}}
\end{enumerate}
Both of these components are typically part of the J distribution.

\paragraph{Install and check prerequisites}

To continue download and install Pandoc and J and run the following
tests; if you succeed you're system is ready for
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/wordpress-to-latex-with-pandoc-and-j-latex-directories-part-2-2/}{WordPress
to \LaTeX\ with Pandoc and J: \LaTeX\ Directories (2)}.

\paragraph{Pandoc Test:} Download the test file: \texttt{cdata.html} and run Pandoc from the
command line:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -o cdata.tex cdata.html
\end{verbatim}

\noindent \texttt{cdata.html} is an example of the HTML code you find in WordPress
export XML \texttt{CDATA} elements. \emph{Note:} required files are also
available in the files sidebar in the \texttt{WordPress to LaTeX}
directory.

\paragraph{J Test:} Start a J session and enter the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
require 'task'

shell  'wget --help'

site=. 'http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/photos/'

shell  'wget ',site,'i-mNK4RHL/0/L/i-mNK4RHL-L.png'
\end{verbatim}

\noindent If the shell command is properly loaded and \texttt{wget.exe} is found
you will see help text. The second shell command downloads an image
file. Downloading post images is part of the overall conversion process.
