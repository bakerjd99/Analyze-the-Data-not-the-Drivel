\end{floatingfigure}Rehab has taught me that I really don't like pain! I wish I could report
that I am a tough guy; that I can happily take a beating and then ask
for more. Alas, that's not me. I've always considered the downside of
stupid stunts and, with a few notable lapses of judgement, managed to
avoid the self-inflicted injuries of my peers.

 I've been more of, ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,''
than a, ``no pain no gain,'' guy. Most of the time this is sensible but
when you are going through rehab the opposite holds. When your
torturers, (therapists), insist on bending your broken body this way and
that way, over and over again, I can assure you it's not pain-free.

Of course there is an upside. You do improve and things get better.
Today I ``walked'' twenty-five meters in my braces using a walker. It
was a post accident record. Every day the distance and time will
increase and in no time I hope to be hiking again. Walking: it's not
overrated.
