\noindent\emph{Posted: 14 Jun 2021 21:03:56}

Not long ago while driving with my \href{https://www.npr.org/}{NPR}
loving wife I was accidentally exposed to a radio panel
``conversation''\footnote{``Conversation'' is lefty speak for shut up and agree!
} about
\emph{offensive} team names. Unless you've been off-planet for the last
few decades you're probably aware that it's no longer acceptable to name
teams after BIPOC'ky\footnote{BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.
} people.
To do so is to commit the heinous crime of \emph{cultural
appropriation.} How naming a football team the ``Redskins'' or a hockey
team the ``Blackhawks'' steals culture is not entirely clear but trust
me it is. BIPOC'ky people are incapable of error. Their opinions,
however nonsensical, are absolute and must not be questioned, especially
by pasty, pink people --- you know racist white guys. This is the
prevailing NPR orthodoxy and the radio panel, comprised of a meek
approval-seeking host, and two sullen \emph{aboriginal youths} (Indian
teenagers) accepted it without a trace of introspection.

The panel went on way too long about the youth's struggle to rename high
school basketball teams and their refusal to stand up and recite
\emph{The Pledge of Allegiance.} I fully sympathized with their take on
The Pledge of Allegiance. It's a creepy loyalty oath that induces more
nausea than loyalty. I hated chanting it as a kid and nobody was forcing
me onto a reservation. Unthinking loyalty is a bad look for sentient
beings.

It's hard to take whining teenagers, even the BIPOC'ky ones, seriously
but as a thought experiment let's assume that baseball teams should not
be given names like the ``Braves.''

What the Hell should we call them?

I'm pretty sure that the people bitching about offensive BIPOC'ky names
will not take to \emph{culturally unappropriated names}. Would changing
``Redskins'' to ``Whiteskins'' fix the problem? Instead of ``Braves''
how about ``Confederates'', or even better, ``Klansmen.'' See no
cultural appropriation!

We've arrived at the fundamental problem. No matter what you call a team
some fragile butthurt pussy boy will crawl out of the pussy boy closet
and moan about how lily-white ``Vikings'' raped and sodomized his even
whiter ancestors and, how dare you, name a team after them! We're living
in an age of cheap outrage.

Now, tone to the contrary, I am keen to solve the \emph{offensive team
name problem:} no greater threat imperils civilization. But, here's the
thing. I'm not a quick-fix guy. I don't want to rename teams only to
rename them again a few years later when new aggrieved parties surface.
I want, dare I say it, a \emph{final solution}, to the offensive team
name problem. If we're going to rename teams, rebrand all their merch,
update their fight songs, and swap out their stadium signs let's do it
right. Let's pick names that have never offended anyone, anywhere,
anytime.

Fortunately, it's easy to concoct such ``names.'' We nerdy People of
Programming (POPS) generate untold billions of inoffensive names every
single day and despite living on a planet of 7.5 billion complainers
we've yet to log a single objection.

What are these inoffensive names?

They go by many monikers with the most famous being
\href{https://www.uuidtools.com/what-is-uuid}{GUIDs (Globally Unique
Identifiers)}. GUIDs are generated by clever algorithms that ensure each
GUID is globally unique. Here's one in hexadecimal
\texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"}.

It's extremely unlikely that anyone on this planet, or any other, has
ever seen this exact GUID before. Also, it's extremely unlikely you will
ever see it again; that's the globally unique bit.
\texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} has no history, no context, no NPR
nuance; there's nothing about this completely novel bit pattern that
could possibly offend anyone. \texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} did not
abuse your ancestors, call you names, or disrespect your authority. It's
even more innocent than a newborn baby because it isn't even white! So,
let's give the ``Redskins'' of the world names like
\texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"}: offensive team name problem solved.

As perfect as \texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} is it has a few
problems. \texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} doesn't lend itself to mob
cheers.

``Go \texttt{9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19} Go,'' is decidedly less catchy
than ``Go Utes Go.''

Also, \texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} won't fit on T-shirts and ball
caps. The cap and T-shirt problem is easily fixed. Simply wrap
\texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} into nice patterns like:

\begin{verbatim}
        925978
        1A92E4
        B5  42
        BE  E9
        585BDE
        E07B19
\end{verbatim}

If that's not \emph{artsy-fartsy} enough map standard alphanumeric
characters to say,
\href{https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/}{Hittite
Unicode},\footnote{I'm taking a chance using Hittite symbols here. God forbid that I
should \emph{culturally appropriate} symbols from a long-dead
civilization. How will I ever pay reparations?
} throw in some gay
colors, and \emph{Voila} you get logo-friendly graphics like:


\captionsetup[figure]{labelformat=empty}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\href{}{\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{hittiteguid3.png}}
\caption{See the following  \LaTeX\  file for generation details: \\ \footnotesize \url{https://github.com/bakerjd99/Analyze-the-Data-not-the-Drivel/blob/master/wp2latex/examples/hittest.tex} \normalsize}
\label{fig:7130x0}
\end{figure}


As for the cheer problem, I agree that
\texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} is a mouthful but it comes with a
life-saving plus. It functions as a fan sobriety test. If you're too
drunk to chant \texttt{"9259781A92E4B542BEE9585BDEE07B19"} you're too drunk to
drive or vote.

So there you have it. Simply substitute GUIDs for offensive team names
and then, for the love of logic, shut the fuck up and attend to real
problems.
