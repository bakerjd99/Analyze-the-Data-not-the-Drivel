\end{floatingfigure}I rarely comment on the ``news'' but the planned execution of
\href{http://michellemalkin.com/2011/09/29/iranian-pastor-yousef-nadarkhani-faces-execution-for-refusing-to-renounce-christianity-where-are-the-hollyweirdos-and-euroweenies-now/}{Yousef
Nadarkhani} for
the \href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/counting-gods/}{make-believe}
crime of Islamic apostasy has really pissed me off. Once again the
Iranian branch of the ``religion of peace'' shows its primitive,
ass-backwards, subhuman side to a stunned world that finds it hard to
believe that \emph{changing your mind about fictitious religious
nonsense is punishable by death!} It's rubbish like this that turned me
into a hardcore atheist. If this is Sharia then Sharia is shit!

Let's be perfectly clear. I am not condemning Iranians. I am married to
an Iranian! I have many lovely Iranian in-laws, and not a single one of
them approves of this atavistic
\href{http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Assinity}{assinity}.
Like civilized people everywhere their feelings alternate between
disgust, shame and rage. While I forgive the Iranian people I condemn
the Iranian regime. The government courts that imposed this sentence are
pathetic throwbacks. They don't belong in the modern world and one day
they won't.

Savages always assume they can bully and terrorize people forever. At
first people are easily cowed but even the most egregious assaults fail
to deter in the long run. The next time the Iranian masses take to the
streets the regime will fall and with the exception of a few
\emph{islaminals} nobody is going to miss it!

\emph{P.S. Before you go all brave fatwa waving kafir killing jihad
warrior on me keep in mind that Missouri is a concealed carry state.}
