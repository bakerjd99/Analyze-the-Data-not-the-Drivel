Yesterday I had cataract surgery, My cataract-infused left eye lens was
removed and replaced with a plastic mono-focal lens. I'm still
recovering from the procedure but I can already see that it's going to
be a brighter and bluer world, My cataracts were literally casting a
yellowish pall on everything. I knew my color sense was off, and I often
worried about how it might be affecting my photo editing, but I'm still
surprised by just how off it was. Even with blurry postoperative vision,
the sky was a richer, purer, brighter blue. It will be a week or so
before my left eye recovers and I will still need glasses for closeup
work, (the mono-focal replacement lens is set to infinity), but I will
definitely be seeing in a new light.
