Finding good key words is not easy. In many ways it is like creating a
good book index. Decent book indexes are carefully constructed
by \emph{\href{http://www.dailywritingtips.com/\%E2\%80\%9Chuman-readers\%E2\%80\%9D-a-tautology/}{human
readers}} that understand what is being indexed and why certain terms
\emph{should be included.} Superior indexes showcase the gems and bury
the garbage. There is a lot of mediocre software out there that purports
to automate this task but I remain unimpressed. Machine indexing is like
machine language translation: they both suffer from a lack of
\emph{real} understanding. I was reminded of how difficult indexing is
while writing some code to update my
\href{http://www.smugmug.com/}{SmugMug} key words.

My first attempt at computing key words followed this recipe:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Run my little
  \href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/command-line-c-smugmug-api-metadata-download/}{C\#
  SmugMug metadata dumper} to update image metadata.
\item
  Sift through the image metadata and extract all current key words.
\item
  Remove
  \href{http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/English-3000-common-words.html}{common
  English words} from current key words.
\item
  Similarly, extract all image caption text and remove common English
  words.
\item
  Sort the remaining caption text key words by frequency.
\item
  Append the frequency sorted caption key words to corresponding current
  key words.
\item
  Take at most seven words from the appended list as key words.
\end{enumerate}
My thinking was high frequency \emph{uncommon} English words would make
good keys. This is generally the case but the removal of common English
words from currently assigned keys was a big mistake.

I take care when naming image files. SmugMug picks up words in image
file names and uses them as default key words. If you have good file
names you will get useful keys automatically. Removing common English
words from file names deleted words that were present for good reasons.
For example: two common English words, ``before'' and ``after,'' are
used in the file names of image restorations like this picture I took in
Cyprus way back in 1968.

\label{fig:416X0}
\end{figure}

I think ``before'' and ``after'' are perfectly good keys for this image.

To avoid such problems I now leave file name words intact and augment
these words with high frequency caption text words and print size keys
like: 4x5, 4x6, 5x7 and 8x10. Print size keys is another story. You can

SmugMug keys} here.
