There is much wailing on the
\href{http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=intertubes}{\emph{intertubes}} about
proposed changes to FCC Internet privacy rules. That horrible orange
Russian stooge~is desecrating the Lightbringer's~enlightened decrees and
the
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/28/republicans-are-poised-to-roll-back-landmark-fcc-privacy-rules-heres-what-you-need-to-know/}{usual
suspects} are having boringly predictable conniption fits. Apparently,
our Internet privacy is \emph{now} under attack and horrible things will
ensue. You poor dumb fucks. You have no Internet privacy; you never did!
I'm amused by Obama worshippers wetting their pants over Internet
privacy; didn't that entire Snowden thing happen while The One was
pushing back the seas? Isn't it a tad hypocritical to whine about the
FCC, a very little fish, when great whites, the NSA, CIA, et cetera, are
feasting on fools?

Now pay attention, I am only going to explain this once. If you are
concerned about Internet privacy you have to look out for yourself. The
FCC is not going to help you. Congress will not rush to your aid. The
President, orange or black, will not defend your interests.
\emph{Government, as it is currently constipated, only serves the donor
class.} Unless you are injecting large bribes into ``the political
system'' you do not have effective representation. I realize it sucks to
be a peon but all is not lost. You don't have any Internet privacy but
you are not powerless.

\emph{The proposed change in FCC rules is predicated on the assumption
that your browsing history is valuable?} It seems there are profit
driven corporations out there that care about how many cat videos you
watch and whether you swipe left or right. They presume that with enough
data mining of your clicks, tweets, and pokes they can craft cruise
missile adds that will fly under your bullshit radar and score direct
hits on your ``buy our shit buttons.'' This entire shaky premise can be
trivially undermined by simple cheap peon countermeasures.

There are two basic approaches: VPN and Dirty Data.

If you want to stop Verizon, CenturyLink, Charter, Comcast or some other
evil mega-corp ISP from recording your browsing history start using a
VPN service. There are many VPN providers available now and this FCC
ruling will probably encourage the formation of even more. See, the FCC
is making VPN great again!

VPN prevents the man-the-middle from being able to view your browsing
history but unfortunately, all this does is transfer your browsing
history from a mega-corp ISP to a mega-corp VPN. If your VPN is in the
good old \emph{fuck-You-S-A} it could still sell your porn rights to the
highest bidder. If you go with a VPN provider choose one that's based
outside the US.

I'm a fan of VPN but if many peons start bypassing their mega-corp ISPs
with VPN our ever-helpful government will probably amend the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act}{abominable
DMCA act} and declare the personal use of VPN an act of domestic
terrorism! I know this sounds crazy but these days it's a criminal act
in the United States for farmers
\href{http://modernfarmer.com/2016/07/right-to-repair/}{to fix their own
damn tractors} if the repairs bypass or replace embedded device
software. Yes, intellectual property rights are that screwed up!

VPN is a viable countermeasure \emph{for now} but Dirty Data is a
countermeasure for the ages. Dirty Data works by sabotaging data. The
idea is simple, cheap and extremely effective. Before data miners can
extract digital gold they have to purge the garbage in their databases.
For most corporations cleaning data is an ongoing struggle. It's always
time-consuming, expensive, and it always threatens the
\href{http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp}{ROI}
of analytic projects. If there's too much shit in the ice cream the
mixture tastes more like shit than ice cream. So how do you mix browsing
history shit into mega-corp ISP ice cream?

If you have lots of free time and you really, really, hate your ISP, you
can strike back with \emph{monkey browsing}. Monkey browsing is an
updated version of that famous monkey on the typewriter. To monkey
browse, visit random websites and randomly click crap on each site. With
judicious keystroke timing, it will be a royal pain for your ISP to
extract your real browsing history from your monkey browsing.

Of course, most of us can't devote a few hours a day to monkey browsing
but fear not; the \emph{monkey-browser-bots} are coming! It wouldn't be
all that hard to automate monkey browsing. Many techniques would work.
Trust me, in short order, an army of monkey-browser-bots will be
delicately stirring shit into mega-corp ISP ice cream. When the signal
to noise ratio exceeds mega-corp ISP ROI thresholds they'll stop trying
to filter shit out of ice cream and move to the next corporate delusion.
\emph{Peon poop is powerful people!}

seeking culture. It’s not your grandmother’s Internet anymore. Surveillance is a
fact of life, and as sad as this sorry fact is cheer up! Half the idiots monitoring
you are barely capable of locating their own buttholes with both hands and a flashlight.
American intelligence agencies have been so wrong, so often, that it’s a good
idea to always discount whatever they’re saying until there is overwhelming
independent corroborating evidence. In the meanwhile, you can 
cheaply punk the “data” they are collecting. Remember, you can whine or undermine!}
