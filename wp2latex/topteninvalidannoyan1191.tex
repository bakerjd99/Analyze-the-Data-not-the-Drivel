I have been in the rehab/old-folks home for eight days: long enough to
adjust to the routine. It's amazing how quickly we get on with a new
normal. This doesn't mean I am comfortable or thrilled with my
circumstances. I have a list of invalid annoyances.

Let's do this from least to most annoying.

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Call bells that ring for hours on end.
\item
  Marginal cable package: cripples don't need HBO.
\item
  Late night nurse chats; I had forgotten about noisy hospitals.
\item
  Butt-plugging food. They have been trying to give me stool softeners
  since my arrival. If my wife wasn't bringing food I would need them.
\item
  Locked courtyards. It's winter and the courtyards are locked to
  protect the elderly. This should be a weather dependent rather than
  seasonal policy.
\item
  Inability to put on my socks.
\item
  Unable to get in or out of my wheelchair without assistance.
\item
  Cannot shower or bathe until my cuts heal
\item
  Peeing into a plastic bottle.
\item
  And the number one annoyance: \textbf{cannot wipe my ass.} I suspect my
  nurses concur.
\end{enumerate}
