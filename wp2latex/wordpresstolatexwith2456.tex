\end{floatingfigure}In this post I will describe the \LaTeX\ directory structure the J script
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/texfrwpxml/TeXfrWpxml.ijs}{\texttt{TeXfrWpxml.ijs}}
is expecting. To convert WordPress export XML to \LaTeX\ with this script
you will have to set up similar directories.

\LaTeX\ documents are built from \texttt{*.tex}\footnote{
\LaTeX\ uses many other file types but key files
are usually \texttt{*.tex} files.
} source code files.
This makes \LaTeX\ more like a compiled programming language than a word
processing program. There are advantages and disadvantages to the \LaTeX\
way. In \LaTeX's favor, the system is enormously adaptable, versatile and
powerful. There is very little that \LaTeX/\TeX\ and
\href{http://www.amazon.com/LaTeX-Companions-Third-Revised-Boxed/dp/0321514432}{associates}
cannot do. Unfortunately,
``\href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKmQW7JTb6s}{with great power
comes great responsibility.}'' \LaTeX\ is demanding! You have to study
\LaTeX\ like any other programming language. It's not for everyone but for
experienced users it's the best way to produce documents with the
highest typographic standards.

\paragraph{\LaTeX\ directory structure}

To use \LaTeX\ efficiently it's wise to pick a document directory
structure and \emph{stick with it.} I use a simple directory layout. Each
document has a root directory. The root directory used by
\texttt{TeXfrWpxml.ijs~}is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lp{0.45\textwidth}} 
   Windows          & \texttt{c:/pd/blog/wp2latex}  \\ 
   Linux            & \texttt{/home/john/pd/blog/wp2latex}            \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent I put my document specific \texttt{*.tex}, \texttt{*.bib},
\texttt{*.sty} and other \LaTeX/\TeX\ files in the root. To handle graphics
I create an immediate subdirectory called \texttt{inclusions}.
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
c:/pd/blog/wp2latex/inclusions
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
The inclusions directory holds the document's \texttt{*.png},
\texttt{*.jpg}, \texttt{*.pdf}, \texttt{*.eps} and other graphics files.
To reference files in the inclusions directory with the standard \LaTeX\
\texttt{graphicx} package insert
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{color,graphicx,subfigure,sidecap}
\graphicspath{{./inclusions/}}
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}
in your preamble. Finally, to track document changes I create a
\href{http://git-scm.com/}{GIT} repository in the root directory.
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
c:/pd/blog/wp2latex/.git
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Self contained directories}

I take care to keep my document directories \emph{self-contained}.
Zipping up the root and inclusions directory collects \emph{all} the
document's files. This means that I sometimes have to copy files that
are used in more than one document. Many \LaTeX\ users maintain a common
directory for such files but I've found that common directories
complicate moving documents around. You're always forgetting something
in the damn common directory or you are copying a
\href{http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=buttload}{buttload}
of mostly irrelevant files from one big confusing common directory to
another.

\paragraph{TeXfrWpxml.ijs files}

The \texttt{TeXfrWpxml.ijs~}script searches for these files in the root
directory.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lp{0.45\textwidth}} 
   \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/Analyze-the-Data-not-the-Drivel/blob/master/wp2latex/bm.tex}{\texttt{bm.tex}}            & Main LaTeX root file  \\ 
   \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/Analyze-the-Data-not-the-Drivel/blob/master/wp2latex/bmamble.tex}{\texttt{bmamble.tex}}  & \LaTeX\ preamble      \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent\texttt{bm.tex} references \texttt{bmtitlepage.tex}. I prefer a separate
title page file; simply comment out this file if you create titles in
other ways. \textbf{The zip file
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/texfrwpxml/wp2latex.zip}{\texttt{wp2latex.zip}}
contains a test directory in the format expected by
\texttt{TeXfrWpxml.ijs}.} It also has a subset of my blog posts already
converted to \LaTeX. To get ready for
\href{https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/wordpress-to-latex-with-pandoc-and-j-using-texfrwpxml-ijs-part-3/}{WordPress
to LaTeX with Pandoc and J: Using TeXfrWpxml.ijs (3)} download
\texttt{wp2latex.zip} and attempt to compile \texttt{bm.tex}. You might
have to download a number of \LaTeX\ packages. Once you have successfully
compiled \texttt{bm.tex~}you are ready for the next step.
