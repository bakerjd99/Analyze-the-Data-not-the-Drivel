Remember \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkqn7O1lHFI}{Mr. Peabody's
Wayback Machine}. Mr Peabody was dog, with a pet boy Sherman, that used
his Wayback time travel machine to visit the past. I'm not sure if he
ever visited the future; that's a question best left to
\href{http://www.berkeleyside.com/2009/12/22/berkeley-history-rocky-and-bullwinkle/}{Rocky
and Bullwinkle historians}. Well, I have Wayback machines; they're
called film and flatbed scanners. I spend way to much time scanning and
restoring old photographs. Over the years I've scanned thousands of
images. It only takes a few minutes to get a high quality scan but it
can take days of image editing to restore old damaged originals. Hence,
I always have a backlog of scanned pictures to fix.

My enthusiasm for this endless task waxes and wanes with my general
photographic energies. A few weeks ago I upgraded my arsenal of DLSR
cameras and lenses. New lenses always give me boast. So lately I've been
out pixel harvesting with a lovely little $f$2.8 macro lens. I think she I
will be an item for years to come --- wide open her bokeh is beautiful.
While I enjoy working with my spanking new crystal clear digital images
I often find myself wandering in my vast image file directories and picking
out old scans to work on. Today I whiled away a rainy afternoon
restoring pictures I took over forty years ago. Here's a shot from my
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Community\_School\_at\_Beirut}{ACS
Beirut Lebanon} boarding school days. This is from an old
\href{http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Instamatic}{Instamatic} camera. I
believe it was my second camera. Over the years my cameras have gotten
better and better but they still cannot go Wayback in time.
