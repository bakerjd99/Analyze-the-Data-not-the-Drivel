I'm exhausted. For the last four nights I've been up late
\emph{\href{http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html}{Lightroom'ing}}
the pictures I took on my
\href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/Trips/USA-and-Canada/Arizona-Toodling-1/7475075\_MrjqMc}{little
Arizona annular eclipse trip}. I'm a new Lightroom user and I'm not
entirely impressed with the program. It's a first class general
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw\_image\_format}{RAW} developer
but I don't think it's as good as
\href{http://www.capturenx.com/en/index.html}{Capture NX} when working
with Nikon NEF files. For the nonce I will keep Lightroom'ing away;
\emph{you have to master something before you can have a valid opinion
about it!}

As annoyed as I am about Lightroom I know, from bitter experience, that
\emph{when I first process images I only see problems.} The composition
sucks. The colors are off. Things are too dark or to light. After a few
dozen disappointments the mood darkens and I wonder just \emph{who the
fuck took all this shit?} But I solider on, waging relentless pixel
warfare, because in few years, when I've forgotten about light curves,
sharpening parameters, edge masks, color spaces and all the technical
\href{http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hoo-ha}{hoo-hah} that goes into
digital image making, I start seeing the pictures not the flaws. I
sometimes catch myself looking at my old pictures and wondering just who
took all these great shots. You change your mind about pictures!

This is why I don't use ``star'' ratings. Most image management systems
have ratings. Lightroom has a five-star system, \href{http://www.cerious.com}{Thumbsplus} does
something similar and every image management tool I've looked at has a
comparable feature. Obviously the masses expect and demand ratings. Too
bad the masses are wrong. In the long run ratings are meaningless. You
really see this with restoration projects. I've spent days
\href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/Themes/Manipulations/Restorations-1/7091264\_pbTtkm}{restoring
pictures} that what I would rate as total crap if I had just shot them.
Yet here I am spending long hours on yesterday's crap.

Restoration work also changes your attitude about duds. In my film days
I ruthlessly pruned my slides and negatives trashing exposures that
didn't meet my standards \emph{of the time}. Now I curse that
\href{http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/The-Way-We-Were/me-edmonton-248039614/473531869\_ocr95-L-3.jpg}{delusional
jackass} for throwing away my precious originals. It's surprising how
useful duds are; they fill in missing details and remind you of your
ever-changing opinions. Save your duds I guarantee you will feel
differently about them in a few years and, of course, others will have
completely different takes.
