A few days after posting a \href{http://www.box.net/shared/qlp4999qre}{J
script} that fixes \href{http://www.exif.org/}{EXIF} timestamps in
\href{http://www.smugmug.com/iphone/smugshot/}{SmugShot} images SmugMug
changed the filename assigned to downloaded SmugShot images.
Originally the layout was:

\vspace{4pt}
\textbf{\emph{SmugMugID}\_smugshot\_\emph{SmugShotID}.jpg}
\vspace{4pt}

This layout was inconsistent with the way SmugMug normally handles
files. Default SmugMug behavior is to \textbf{leave filenames
unchanged}. This contrasts with other photo sites,
(\href{http://www.flickr.com/}{you know who you are}), \emph{that rename
your sacred files to suit their indexing schemes.} A few days ago
SmugMug corrected this discrepancy and downloaded SmugShot images
reverted to their original format:

\vspace{4pt}
\textbf{smugshot\_\emph{SmugShotID}.jpg}
\vspace{4pt}

This fix broke \texttt{smugshotexif}: see:
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/smugshot-metadata-mess/}{my
previous post}. I have modified
\href{http://www.box.net/shared/qlp4999qre}{\texttt{SmugShotFix.ijs}} to handle
the current format and the older one. I will keep tweaking this hack
until SmugShot's sloppy EXIF handling is corrected.
