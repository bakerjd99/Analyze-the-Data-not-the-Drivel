Yesterday I transferred from Surreyplace to St. John's rehabilitation
hospital. St. John's it's a mainstream rehab hospital and is better
equipped to deal with my situation. Now that I am allowed active leg
movements the therapy will get more intense. To be honest I am not
looking forward to longer and more painful sessions. Yes, I am a
complete girly man when it comes to searing pain! I will have a better
idea of what's in store for me after tomorrow.

Whatever happens in therapy they will not be waking me up at 4:30 am to
draw blood! You can imagine my delight at being roused from a crappy
nights sleep, (try sleeping in python tight leg braces), and then being
poked by a zealous staff vampire that took singular delight in telling
me this little suck would be a daily ritual. Whoa cowboy: there had
better be really good medical reasons for waking me up!

Half an hour later another nurse came in and tried to make me take a
stomach lining pill. People it's 5:00 am I am not going to start
pointless drugs at such an hour. Then, shortly after refusing the
stomach pill another nurse was back to administer an EKG. Clearly sleep
was not on the agenda.

I've been told all these tests were part of a baseline workup and that I
will not be subjected to many of them tomorrow. The vampire will have to
suck elsewhere.
I went through the same thing at St. Luke's and Surreyplace. I don't
want to train hospital staff in the delicate art of \emph{me} maintenance but
it appears unavoidable.
