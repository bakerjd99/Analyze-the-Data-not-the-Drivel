Grids are the most important GUI user object. It's hard to think of a
user-friendly data munching application that doesn't have a grid beating
at its heart. Consequently, any serious \emph{GUI interface contender}
must support grids. My
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/jhs-meets-mathjax/}{previous
post} showed how to use \href{http://www.mathjax.org/}{MathJax} with
\href{http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/NYCJUG/2011-02-08/HelloWorldInJHS}{JHS}.
MathJax is an impressive and important JavaScript library; it clearly
demonstrates the potential of CHJ\footnote{
 CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
} GUI
interfaces but let's face it, mathematical typesetting will not win many
consulting contracts. Grids won't seal the deal either but their
\emph{absence} is a huge ``next'' signal. To support serious business
and technical applications JHS needs grids.

Fortunately, the JavaScript world is
\href{http://www.hotscripts.com/blog/15-javascript-data-grids-enhance-html-tables/}{grid
saturated}. The difficulty is not finding a grid but choosing among
dozens of candidates. For this demo I Googled around and found
\href{http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGrid/}{DHTMLX}. According to
this \href{http://www.dhtmlx.com/blog/?p=1525}{probably biased article}
the DHTMLX grid performs well on large inputs and, more importantly,
there is an
\href{http://www.dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGrid/license.shtml?gpl}{open
source} version.

You have to start somewhere so I opted to use DHTMLX to build a simple
CSV file editor. The CSV files I am going to edit are \texttt{TAB}
delimited text files. Each file has a fixed number of columns with
column names in the first row. Here is
\href{https://www.box.com/s/0sm9bjgclnqu0czlpal6}{an example} \texttt{TAB}
delimited file. The idea is to load the file data into the grid. Tweak a
few rows and save the result. By increasing the size of the CSV file we
can gauge the performance of the grid. Let's get started.

Using the DHTMLX grid requires some preparation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Create a local directory and edit J's
  \texttt{\textasciitilde{}config/folders.cfg} to reference the
  directory with the name \texttt{GridDemo}.
  \texttt{jpath '\textasciitilde{}GridDemo'} should return the full
  directory path.
\item
  Download the files in the
  \href{https://www.box.com/s/n7ty82nv6nslia4drphs}{GridDemo} folder and
  copy them to \texttt{\textasciitilde{}GridDemo}.
\item
  Download the Standard Edition (Version 3.5) of
  \href{http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGrid/index.shtml}{DHTMLX}.
  The distribution file \texttt{dhtmlxGrid.zip} contains the grid source
  and supporting files.
\item
  Extract the \texttt{/dhtmlxGrid/codebase/} directory from
  \texttt{dhtmlxGrid.zip} and copy the entire directory tree to
  \texttt{\textasciitilde{}GridDemo}.
\item
  Also extract \texttt{/dhtmlxGrid/samples/common} from
  \texttt{dhtmlxGrid.zip} and copy the directory to
  \texttt{\textasciitilde{}GridDemo}.
\end{enumerate}

When you're finished the top-level of \texttt{\textasciitilde{}GridDemo}
will look like the following where names without extensions are
directories.

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
calendar           dhtmlxgrid.js         GridDemo.ijs   t100rows.txt
common             dhtmlxgrid_skins.css  imgs           t5000rows.txt
dhtmlxcommon.js    excells               jodoval.png
dhtmlxgridcell.js  ext                   skins
dhtmlxgrid.css     favicon.ico           t1000rows.txt
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent The main J script is
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}GridDemo\textbackslash{}GridDemo.ijs}. Start
JHS and load this file.

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
    load '~GridDemo/GridDemo.ijs'
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent Then browse to this site.

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]
\begin{verbatim}
    http://127.0.0.1:65001/GridDemo
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent If all goes well you will see the following \texttt{GridDemo} page after
pressing the \texttt{Edit Grid} button.

To load and edit files enter their fully qualified names in the
\texttt{Input} and \texttt{Output} boxes and press \texttt{Edit Grid}.
To edit a cell double-click it. To save changes press
\texttt{Save Grid.}\footnote{
 The freebie version of DHTMLX does not support grid serialization.
  \href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/more-about-jhs-with-dhtmlx-the-grid/}{Here
  is how to roll your own}.
} There are more
sophisticated ways to pick files on JavaScript pages. It's easy to pop
up standard host OS file dialogs but it's not particularly easy to
determine host directory paths.
\href{http://robertnyman.com/2010/12/16/utilizing-the-html5-file-api-to-choose-upload-preview-and-see-progress-for-multiple-files/}{This
post} outlines the demons web programmers must slay to select host
files. JHS circumvents these difficulties by asking the J server, which
is a typically a \emph{local console process}, to do the dirty work.
JavaScript's access to local files is limited for security reasons but J
has no such restrictions.
\href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fSj6LxsZes}{Use the force Luke!}

Three test files \texttt{t100rows.txt}, \texttt{t1000rows.txt}, and
\texttt{t5000rows.txt} are included with the demo. On my test machines
load times vary from fractions of a second for the smaller files to nine
seconds for the largest. This is competitive with the basic \texttt{C\#}
grid control and fast enough for serious work.

In subsequent posts I will explore JavaScript/JHS graphics options and
start the process of integrating, grids, graphs and MathJax with JHS.
