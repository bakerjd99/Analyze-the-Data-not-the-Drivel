In 2022 reality once again asserted dominance over wishful-thinking
naked apes. Governments everywhere gave up on COVID. The virus won, as
many cynics said it would three years ago. We now live with COVID, as if
we had a choice, and it will kill some of us from time to time. Our
transition to low carbon emission energy is going so well that many find
themselves enjoying winter in cold dark rooms. The military geniuses
that precipitated the war in Ukraine have been reminded that war plans
do not survive combat. The wizards that prognosticate on inflation,
deficit financing, the balance of payments, the overhyped ``supply
chain,'' the price of gas, and other things \emph{economical} have once
again been shown to be completely useless. The only way to make money on
mainstream news is to track stock purchases by members of Congress as
the
\href{https://www.investmentnews.com/pelosis-portfolio-performance-now-wrapped-in-an-etf-218304}{Pelosi
Portfolio} has demonstrated. Yeah, there's absolutely no insider trading
in Congress, just as there was no gambling going on in Rick's Casablanca
casino. Cynics are rarely surprised by life's parade of nitwits. We
expect you to screw up, to learn nothing, and to screw up again, and
again. A popular meme succinctly sums it up:

\end{figure}

However, when cynics are surprised or impressed it's a pretty good
indicator that something new is afoot. 2022 may have been a mostly
shitty year but it was also the year generative AI reached the masses.
Such systems are now producing photorealistic images of imaginary
people, plausible art in many styles, and essay answers to simple text
prompts. For example, when prompted with the phrase, ``a red rock desert
landscape floating in a glass sphere,'' the generative AI
\href{https://midjourney.com}{midjourney.com} generated:

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption[\href{https://midjourney.com}{midjourney.com} red rock desert in glass sphere]{}
\label{fig:7681x1}
\end{figure}

To my naïve eyes, it seems that midjourney.com \emph{understood} my
request.

Modern generative AI systems cast a \emph{super-Eliza} spell. Eliza was,
in retrospect, one of the first \emph{chatbots}, it attempted to
simulate a noncommittal therapist. Eliza's creator Joseph Weizenbaum
describes in his 1976 book
\emph{\href{https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Power-Human-Reason-Calculation/dp/0716704633}{Computer
Power and Human Reason}} how his secretary would ask for privacy when
conversing with her ``therapist'' Eliza. Eliza was a complete fraud, it
didn't understand anything, its code was surprisingly simple, and the
whole point of Eliza was to undermine the idea that computers would ever
understand us. Nevertheless, Eliza still fooled some. The generative AIs
of today (2022) are far more sophisticated and powerful than Eliza and
are fooling, or impressing many. I count myself among the impressed.

Here are some of \href{https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/}{ChatGPT}'s
abridged answers (they're not kidding about the chat part of
\emph{chatbot}) to some of my queries.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Me:} Explain formal geometric proof systems.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ChatGPT:} A formal proof system is a set of rules and axioms
that are used to prove theorems in a logical and rigorous manner. In the
context of geometry, a formal proof system is a set of rules and axioms
that are used to prove theorems about geometric figures and their
properties.

There are several different proof systems that have been developed for
geometry, including Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, and
synthetic geometry. Each proof system has its own set of axioms and
rules, which are used to prove theorems about geometric figures and
their properties.

In a formal proof system, a theorem is a statement that is to be proven,
and a proof is a logical argument that demonstrates the truth of the
theorem. The proof consists of a series of logical steps, each of which
must be justified by one of the axioms or rules of the proof system
\ldots{}
\end{quote}

ChatGPT's answer is a good basic wordy answer. There's nothing
outrageously wrong here. If a high school student turned in
something similar, I would give the student a C+.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Me:} How many authentic ancient mathematical artifacts exist?
\end{enumerate}

I've been trying to assess how much source material underpins our
mathematical origin stories. As ChatGPT was ``trained'' on many millions
of web pages I thought it may come up with something I was unaware he.
Here is its answer.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ChatGPT:} There are many ancient mathematical artifacts that
have been preserved from various civilizations around the world. These
artifacts provide valuable insights into the mathematical knowledge and
practices of the time, and they are important for understanding the
history and development of mathematics.

Some examples of ancient mathematical artifacts include:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, which is an ancient Egyptian
  mathematical text dating back to around 1650 BC.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, which is another ancient Egyptian
  mathematical text dating back to around 1890 BC.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  The Plimpton 322 tablet, which is a Babylonian clay tablet containing
  a table of numbers and geometric figures.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  The Antikythera mechanism, which is an ancient Greek mechanical
  calculator used to predict astronomical phenomena.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  The Ishango bone, which is a bone tool with markings that may
  represent early counting and arithmetic.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There are many other ancient mathematical artifacts that have been
discovered and studied, including tablets, scrolls, and manuscripts from
various civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans, and Chinese. These
artifacts provide valuable insights into the mathematical practices and
knowledge of the time, and they are an important part of the history of
mathematics.
\end{quote}

This answer is impressive and disappointing. All of the cited artifacts
are real and can be found in museums. Unfortunately, I was already aware
of these objects. I was hoping ChatGPT would mention something I was
unaware of. I had better luck with my next question.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Me}: What is a current or new theorem from plane Euclidean
  geometry?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ChatGPT}: \ldots{} There are also many new theorems that have
been proven in recent years, some of which involve more advanced
concepts and techniques. For example, a recent theorem in plane
Euclidean geometry is the "unit distance graph" theorem, which states
that given any set of points in the plane, there exists a graph (a
collection of points connected by lines) such that the distance between
any two points on the graph is either one or two. This theorem was
proven by János Pach and Géza Tóth in 2016 \ldots{}
\end{quote}

This was the first time I had heard of the unit distance graph theorem.
Unit distance graphs are
real\footnote{  Unit distance graphs are as real as any other abstract mathematical
  entity.
} and %\protect\hypertarget{fnref1}{\protect\hyperlink{fn1}{\textsuperscript{1}}}
there is a vast literature regarding them. I have been unable to
verify that ChatGPT's citation is legitimate. I found only one 2016
paper with both of these authors:
\emph{\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310464347_Note_on_k-planar_crossing_numbers/citation/download}{Note
on k-planar crossing numbers, 10.1016/j.comgeo.2017.06.015,
Computational Geometry}.} ChatGPT may be correct or it's
\emph{hand-waving} with the best of them. In either case, I learned
something.

Finally, I asked ChatGPT:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  \textbf{Me}: What do you think about the blog \href{https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org}{analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org}?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ChatGPT}: As an AI language model, I do not have personal
opinions or thoughts about specific websites or blogs. I am trained to
provide general information and answer questions to the best of my
ability based on my training data, which consists of a large dataset of
texts from various sources, including books, articles, and websites.

I am not able to browse the internet or access specific websites, so I
am unable to provide any information or commentary on the blog
\href{https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org}{analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org}. It would be best to visit the blog and
read the content for yourself in order to form your own opinions about
it.
\end{quote}

\emph{So ChatGPT advocates reading and forming your own opinions.}
Sadly, I'm detecting more ``intelligence'' in this answer than in most
Internet chat forums and \emph{Twatter} threads.
