In the last ten years, we've moved five
times.\footnote{Frequent moves are a good way to dodge jury duty.

In a few days, I will
increment that count. We are moving to Santa Fe New Mexico. Our previous
perambulations were driven by work. We went where the jobs were and they
were all over.

Because I have spent a lifetime moving for work I have no patience or
sympathy for people who insist on staying put.

``I can't leave here because \ldots{} blah, blah, blah,'' said every
lazy whiner ever.

If you have to move to find a job get off your fat ass and move. Humans
evolved on the move. Our distant ancestors trekked great distances
foraging and hunting. We are happiest when moving. Putting down roots is
for plants, not people. \emph{I'll eventually settle down when I'm
dead.} Until then I am on the move.

Moving is old hat; what's different this time is picking a place first.
For over twenty-five years I've been a \emph{wandering software
developer}. This is beyond idiotic. The most portable stuff in the world
is software. The internet makes it possible to create software anywhere
and deploy it everywhere almost cost-free. There's no need to pile
programmers into pits to extract bits. Theoretically, all software
developers could work remotely, but in case you haven't noticed, we
don't live a theoretical world.

It's easier for management to impose discipline and administer idiocies
like SOX compliance if uppity developers are in the same room. Remote
discipline is too easily mitigated with the mute button meaning
management must come up with good ideas to herd their far-flung cats.
Some enlightened outfits successfully manage productive remote
developers but frankly most are struggling or openly hostile to the
idea.

When it first occurred to me, way back in the 1980s, that commuting to
an actual office was unnecessary I thought that within a decade or two
most software development organizations would embrace remote work. The
cost savings and enhanced access to global talent seemed like total
no-brainers. Well, for many reasons, some good, (like getting smart
people together), and some stupid, (see SOX), the brave new world of
ubiquitous remote workers remains an infuriating work in progress.

I expect this muddle to eventually resolve but in the meanwhile, I am no
longer willing to abide locales that do not suit me. So, for this move,
we picked a spot, Santa Fe, that mostly meets our esoteric geographic
preferences and then started looking for a job. Santa Fe is a small city
so it took a little longer to find a good job but this thing called the
internet also simplifies job hunting.

I've enjoyed my Saint Louis sojourn but like many

of the 19\textsuperscript{th} century}, it's time to head down the Santa
Fe Trail.

decent stargazing.}
