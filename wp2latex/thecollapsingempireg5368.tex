The Collapsing Empire (CE) is a breezy fun to read space opera. Because I
rate books on Goodreads mostly on how much I enjoyed them I gave CE a
solid four. If you're looking for a few hours away from planet moron
(Earth) CE is worth the time. While I enjoyed CE it's unlikely I will be
following this series as it unfolds in however many books the author and
his publisher manage to flog in the future. I've reached the point in my
life where entertainment is no longer sufficient. I demand new ideas and
different ways of looking at things from what I read. By this standard
CE barely rates a one.

The only moderately new notion here is that of ``The Flow.'' The Flow is
CE's magic element. It's the story element that enables a human
interstellar civilization. The Flow plays the same role in CE that the
ocean does in Moby Dick. The ocean is not considered a character in Moby
Dick but try imagining the novel without it! Remove The Flow from CE and
you are left with stock characters, stock court politics, stock
predictable disputes, and a tiny little universe that, trust me, feels
more stunted than a night spent under a clear dark sky looking at real
stars.

As a final note: I'd advise the author to refrain from dispensing his
opinions about real-world politics. Nothing ruins a book faster than
conflating actual authors with their fictional characters. Many years
ago I was on the verge of reading Anne Rice's vampire books but then I
had the good luck to see an interview of Anne Rice going on about how
her characters were her lovers. She wasn't being metaphorical; the woman
is nuts. I decided right on the spot that it was unlikely such a
delusional nitwit was worthy of my sustained attention. Authors labor
under an unspoken Fight Club rule. ``The first rule of fiction writing
is: stay the Hell out of your fiction writing!''
