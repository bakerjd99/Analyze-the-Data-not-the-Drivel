 \end{floatingfigure} I sat through Jennifer Lopez's new Netflix movie \emph{Atlas} the other
night. \emph{Atlas} is what I call generic low-IQ science fiction. It
sports many sci-fi elements: evil AIs, good AIs, warm heroines (Jennifer
is way too old to be considered \emph{hot}), robots, spaceships, space
marines, explosions, and ridiculous apocalyptic plot lines. \emph{Atlas}
has been \href{https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_2024}{thoroughly
roasted online}. Many are calling it a
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/you-re-about-to-get-a-sale-on-nvidia-jim-cramer-shares-insight-on-buying-during-pullbacks/ar-BB1n9fmx}{woke
disaster}. I'm not one of those people. Yes, \emph{Atlas} is silly,
cartoonish, ill-conceived, lazy, and unimaginative, but if you look
around, you'll see that's typical for phone-it-in sci-fi movies. For
every \emph{Arrival} or \emph{2001,} there are scores of braindead
\href{https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Unobtanium}{unobtanium}
\href{https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prometheus_2012}{promethean}
abominations. I had low expectations when I pushed \emph{Atlas's} play
button, and things were unfolding pretty much as anticipated, i.e., I
was pleasantly pissing away two hours watching CGI robots bash each
other to smithereens until my stupefied brain registered an unfortunate
throwaway \emph{sentence}. This sentence wrecked the already marginal
\emph{Atlas} experience and forced me to write this rant.

What set me off?

I'm not issuing spoiler alerts. Low-IQ sci-fi does not merit it. When
\emph{Atlas's} evil AI flees Earth, vowing to return for revenge,
middle-aged and plump-butted Jennifer Lopez (Atlas Shepard) is tasked
with interrogating (torturing actually) one of his AI accomplices to
find the big bad guy. She quickly finds him in the \emph{Andromeda
Galaxy}. My inner amateur astronomer bullshit alarm went off.

So, in this sci-fi universe, we not only have interstellar travel, but
we also have intergalactic travel. In case you're keeping score, sci-fi
intergalactic travel is rare. It's not in the original \emph{Dune},
\emph{Star Trek}, \emph{Star Wars}, or \emph{Foundation} universes. And
the reasons for this are clear; Douglas Adams said it best:

\begin{quote}
Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly
big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the
chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.
\end{quote}

A single garden-variety galaxy like our Milky Way harbors hundreds of
billions of stars: plenty of stages for sci-fi plots. When you start
popping from galaxy to galaxy, your stage count blows up to ten
sextillion.\footnote{I would strongly advise learning
\href{https://lcn2.github.io/mersenne-english-name/tenpower/tenpower.html}{large number words}. With runaway inflation, you will need them long before
global warming bakes our naked ape asses.
} That's 10\textsuperscript{22} for exponent lovers. This is ridiculously
vast. Even Steven King, cranking out one potboiler after another for the
next million years, couldn't fill our actual universe with stories.

You might interject, ``Well, John, what's it to you? Why do you care?''

I care because I like some coherence in my plots.

When the genius-level evil AI flees Earth for Andromeda, you must ask
why he would ever return. If you can fly from galaxy to galaxy, why stop
at Andromeda? Keep going, you dumb fuck; you have trillions of galaxies
to hide in. Even plump-butted Jennifer Lopez can't search the entire
universe. Why come back? The evil AI tells us he must return and purge
humanity because we are self-destructive creatures that will destroy
ourselves and everything we touch. OK, I respect that argument. We are
destructive little shits, and we probably will destroy ourselves, but
get a grip. We are not going to take down the entire
universe.\footnote{I am assuming the vacuum is stable.}
Even if all our interstellar dreams come true and we spread throughout
the galaxy and fuck over millions of star systems, the greater cosmos
still won't notice. Trashing the universe will always be beyond the
powers of naked apes.

Why doesn't the genius \emph{Atlas} evil AI find a galaxy far, far away
and wait until we destroy ourselves? He's immortal; there's no hurry.
So it takes a few millennia for humans to self-destruct: big freaking
deal. Why take the risk of seeking redundant revenge? This doesn't seem
like genius-level AI thinking to me. I don't know why the retarded
\emph{Atlas} screenwriters dragged the \emph{Andromeda Galaxy} into
their hot mess. They probably wanted to plant an allusion; it makes
people think they're clever when they catch allusions, but whatever the
reason, the \emph{Atlas} screenwriters have an acute case of \emph{Tiny
Universe Syndrome}.

\emph{Tiny Universe Syndrome} is the tendency to project our tiny,
overcrowded world onto the universe. It's a complete scale and
imagination failure and betrays the astronomical ignorance of its hosts.
\emph{Tiny Universe Syndrome} is harmless in sci-fi potboilers, but
unfortunately, it shows up in reality. If you've ever read histrionic
screeds about
\href{https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/environmental-impact-space-debris-how-to-solve-it/}{space
pollution}, China taking
\href{https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1249249941/nasa-bill-nelson-moon-artemis-china-starliner}{control
of the moon}, or snowflakes triggered by the idea of
\href{https://theconversation.com/the-billionaire-space-race-reflects-a-colonial-mindset-that-fails-to-imagine-a-different-world-165235}{colonizing
other planets}, then you've encountered \emph{Tiny Universe Syndrome}.
Recently, I had an online spat about
\href{https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/niac/niac-studies/pulsed-plasma-rocket-ppr-shielded-fast-transits-for-humans-to-mars/}{PPR
rocket exhaust}. PPR is a refinement of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)}{old
Orion nuclear propulsion} idea. Instead of detonating \emph{biggly}
atomic bombs to propel your spacecraft, detonate \emph{smallish}
bomblets instead. PPR \emph{pollutes} the interplanetary medium with
energetic ions, and the dolt I was quarreling with thought this was a
serious problem in immediate need of UN regulation. I calmly pointed out
that even if billions of PPR spacecraft were blasting ions into the
interplanetary medium, it would be insignificant compared to the solar
wind. Also, the solar wind works like a giant natural waste disposal
system that blows ions into galactic space. This didn't matter to my
opponent; he was driven by envy, not physics. You see, only a privileged
few might ride on PPR rockets. This is intolerable. It's better if we
all remain equitably trapped on Earth, policing our microaggressions and
misgenderings until we go extinct. Given such a grim future, an evil AI
genocide is a mercy killing.
