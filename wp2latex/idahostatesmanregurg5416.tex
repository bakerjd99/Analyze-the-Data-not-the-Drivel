The other day while eating lunch in my employer's cafeteria I picked up
the fish wrap version of the \emph{Idaho Statesman}. My employer kindly
subscribes to the Statesman and scatters copies around the office so I
don't have to spend my money on what is usually a slightly left of
center, sane, and boring publication. The \textit{Statesman} is constrained by
the decidedly right of center leanings of Idaho but on some days they
let their inner left-wing freak fly and boy did it fly when they boldly
reported:
\href{http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/state/idaho/article167378712.html}{Idaho
named the second-most hateful state in the U.S.}

I always thought we were number one!

I read the article to see who beat us in the prestigious hate rankings
and would you believe Montana.

Montana?

My Spidey statistics sense started tingling. Was it my fault? In the
last year I have lived in both Idaho and Montana, and being a hate group
of one, \emph{I hate the sloppy use of misleading statistics}, I may
have skewed the rankings. Some co-workers remarked that if I only I had
moved from Montana earlier Idaho would be number one.

Whenever I see overtly political opinions expressed with decimals I set
my bullshit detectors
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc}{on eleven} and start
analyzing the data, not the drivel.

Exactly how were these state hate rankings calculated? Here is how it's
done.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
%\tightlist
\item
  The \href{https://www.splcenter.org/}{South Poverty Law Center} (SPLC)
  has developed a precise scientific instrument that determines
  if~arbitrary groups of people are a hate group. Compared to the SPLC
  hate group meter \href{https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/}{LIGO's detection
  of gravity waves} is just trivial physics. In case you are wondering I
  am being sarcastic. There are no hate group meters! SPLC designations
  cannot be checked like the mass of the electron can be checked. They
  are merely expressing opinions about groups they don't like. However,
  for the sake of calculation, \emph{let's assume SPLC hate group counts
  reflect some fundamental reality.}
\item
  State hate rankings are expressed as hate groups per million. For
  example, Idaho's ranking is 7.1/million. This value is computed by the
  simple formula.

\[(1000000/StatePopulation) * (SPLCHateGroupCount)\]

Plugging in the SPLC values for Idaho we get:

\[(1000000/1695178) * 12 = 7.078902629\]

Which, when rounded up\footnote{The SPLC is a left-wing organization so they will round-up. White
  supremacists and other \emph{wrong-thinkers} will round
  down.
} to
one decimal, equals 7.1; this matches the value reported by
\href{http://247wallst.com/special-report/2017/08/14/10-states-with-the-most-hate-groups-3/4/}{24/7
Wall Street}: the primary source cited by the \textit{Statesman}.
\end{enumerate}

I put together a little spreadsheet that applies this naive calculation
to the ten most hateful states and it completely replicates the 24/7
hate ranking. The recalculated values are shown below and if you really
must check my calculations you can download my spreadsheet

Now, for extra credit, what is wrong with this calculation? Remember, I
am assuming SPLC's dubious and entirely subjective hate group counts are
correct and I am using current state populations. So what is wrong? What
renders this apparently precise analysis utterly meaningless, deceptive,
and frankly so stupid that numerate adults should be embarrassed to
parrot such nonsense in public.

If you haven't spotted the problem yet ask yourself. ``How big are these
hate groups?''

I come from Montana. It doesn't surprise me that Montana harbors ten
``hate groups'', but what does that mean? It probably means there are a
few dozen nuts running around in fatigues kicking dogs and yelling at
people to keep off their property. \emph{You need to know how many
people are in the ``hate groups'' to calculate a meaningful per capita
statistic. \textbf{Group hate is not a thing but individual hate is!}}

I suspect the 24/7 authors and the \textit{Statesman} know that ratio ranking is,
to use a millennial word, ``problematic'', but we all know the primary
purpose of such facile reports (fake news) is to provide a seemingly
credible reference that can be re-tweeted, and linked, \emph{ad
infinitum} by innumerate partisan dolts when they're enjoying their
five-minute social media hates.
