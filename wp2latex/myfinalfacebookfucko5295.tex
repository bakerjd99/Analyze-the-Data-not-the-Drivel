It's the start of a new year and much has changed. This week we moved
into a new house. Our move has been an eight month and four state ordeal
but I am hoping we will be here for some time. I am tired of moving and
our frequent moves are confusing our self-appointed digital overlords.
This afternoon, after unpacking and assembling the table I am now
writing on, I tried to login to Facebook using a borrowed library
hotspot. The Boise Library consortium is now lending out Internet
Hotspot devices. My wife put one on hold about a month ago and she got
an email the other day that the device was ready to be picked up at the
Eagle branch. It will be a week or two before our local broadband
supplier can wire up our new house so the hotspot perfectly hit our
Internet dead spot. We picked it up and I'm using it now.

Getting back to Facebook. My login attempt failed. Facebook detected yet
another change in my connection IP address and asked me to verify my
account. I've done this before. I was expecting a text or reset email
but no, this time the bastards had the sheer unmitigated gall to ask for
proper government ID. They want scans of driver's licenses, passports,
social security cards and so forth. This was the last straw. I couldn't
even login to delete my account so I sent this message to
security@facebookmail.com.

\emph{Dear Security at Facebook,}

\emph{It's so good of you to ask if I was trying to access my account
from a new IP.~ Yes, that new login attempt was me. For reasons that do
not concern you I move around a lot. It's irritating that you track IPs
and harass users when they go to another coffee shop or library.}

\emph{This has happened in the past and I have jumped through your
irritating hoops to reset the account. Prior to,~today you did not ask
for PROPER GOVERNMENT ID! \textbf{There is no fucking way in hell I will
be uploading scans of driver's licenses, passports, social security
numbers, or any other form of official ID.} It's bad enough that
proper~authorities force us to use these documents but, the last time I
looked Facebook is not an authority! We don't have to show proper ID to
vote in many states but apparently it's required to browse your steaming
pile of distracting rubbish.}

\emph{I have always hated Facebook and the only reason I have maintained
my tiny footprint in your sewer is to catch a little gossip from real
friends and family members. I have done my best to keep my friend list
short, my security options on maximum, and my profile information scant
and useless. I know you are a giant data mining operation. You entice
idiots with cat videos then quietly monitor their mostly boring and
pointless lives with the sole aim of selling this information to third
parties. Well, count me out! This will be the last byte stream from}
moi. \emph{If I could login I would delete my account but I since I will
not change my lovely gorilla~profile picture or give proper ID I will
have to simply orphan my account. I have already deleted my phone app
and purged my browsers of your vile links. I will never login to
Facebook again.}

\emph{I always knew this day was coming. I had long ago decided to drop
Facebook when a few family members tired of your trash. I don't waste a
lot of time on Facebook, but be honest, even you know it's nothing but a
complete} \emph{waste of time.}

\emph{In this case, parting is not sweet sorrow, it's like being
released from an insane asylum.}

\emph{Anonymously yours}
