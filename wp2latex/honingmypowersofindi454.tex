For years I thought it was rude to ignore people now I glory in it. In
our overly social networked age it is vital to hone your powers of
indifference. We cannot care about everyone or everything and we
shouldn't even try. Here are some people and issues I am ignoring.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Gay Marriage:} Gay marriage is not a human rights issue. The
  real problem is a property issue. When gay dudes expire their partners
  frequently complain, (gay people complaining how novel), about how
  mean and nasty people are about settling estates and dividing up the
  booty. What the hell does this have to do with marriage? I am in favor
  of abolishing all tax and property distinctions between the married
  and unmarried and reinforcing property rights. It frosts my balls that
  unmarried wage earners subsidize married people with higher per capita
  taxes. It pisses me off that drag queens cannot leave their millions
  to their bum buddies without sleazy estate fights.
  \href{http://mises.org/daily/2569}{If your property rights are not
  protected your human rights are irrelevant.}\emph{}
\item
  \textbf{Global warming:} Yeah, the world is slowly warming and it
  might be a problem by the middle of this century. Unfortunately by the
  middle of the century I am dead so, for me, global warming is like the
  increase in the
  \href{http://j.dollan.home.bresnan.net/MUSunLife.html}{Sun's
  luminosity a billion years from now} or, even worse,
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future\_of\_an\_expanding\_universe\#Star\_formation\_ceases}{when
  all the stars go dark in a few hundred trillion years.} Fifty years, a
  billion years, a hundred trillion years it doesn't matter I am still
  dead. Next issue please.
\item
  \textbf{President Obama}: I had a bad feeling when I heard his
  \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2pZSvq9bto}{infamous oceans
  rolled back speech} during the Democratic convention. It was one of
  those spectacularly stupid remarks that forever stain one's
  reputation. Well after two years of campaigning and one year of inept
  governing it's official: nothing to learn here. My strategy now is to
  limit this administration's damage to \emph{moi!} The rest of you can
  enjoy your hope and change.
\item
  \textbf{Creationists}: Life does not make sense without evolution just
  like mountain ranges and deep-sea trenches do not make sense without
  continental drift. Very few creationists rail against continental
  drift because we can see it happening. The
  \href{http://www.evlbi.org/links/links.html}{VLBI} radio telescope
  array is calibrated on a regular basis because the antennas are
  sitting on moving continental plates and the precise millimeter scale
  distance between them is always changing. The process of evolution is
  still up and running and will be long after
  \href{http://creationistidiocy.blogspot.com/2009/02/morons-of-month-holy-trinity-of-stupid.html}{all
  creationist dipshits} are fossilized.
\item
  \textbf{Stock Tips and other Financial prognostications}: Investing
  your own money is a wonderful education in the fallibility of
  prophets. If it was so damn easy we would all be rich. I observe the
  contrary.
\item
  \textbf{CNN. MSNBC, FOX, ABC, NBC, CBC and BBC news}: Please just
  \href{http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=F.O.A.D.}{FOAD}
  and free up some valuable bandwidth. You are no longer relevant and
  are simply wasting our time.
