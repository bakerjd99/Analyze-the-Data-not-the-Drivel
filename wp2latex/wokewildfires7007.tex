For the last two weeks we've been inhaling woke, California, Oregon, and
Washington, wildfire smoke. Fire season, yeah it's a season, is an
annual ``thing'' in the Pacific Northwest. Every summer and fall fires
break out and ruin air quality for weeks on end. As
\href{https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm}{``nearly
85 percent of wildland fires in the United States are caused by
humans''} I was hoping that the Wuhan Coronavirus lockdowns would reduce
the number of fires this year. \emph{Fewer morons in the woods mean
fewer fires.} Summer started off fire-free but when the lockdowns ended
they returned with a vengeance. Naked apes are proven
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/wildfires-rage-false-antifa-rumors-spur-pleas-police-n1239881}{accidental
arsonists and sometimes intentional arsonists}. Just like Batman's Joker
a lot of dumb shits
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc}{just want to watch
things burn}.

Speaking of dumb shits, the governors of Wokeland West, California,
Oregon, and Washington assure us that Climate Change is the real
wildfire villain. It has nothing to do with fire starting idiots, insane
\href{https://www.quora.com/Why-are-fire-breaks-not-established-in-California?share=1}{building
codes that do not require firebreaks}, the lack of public fire safety
education,
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/us/pge-guilty-camp-fire-california/index.html}{incompetent
electric utilities}, forest management policies
\href{https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/11/californias-wildfire-controlled-prescribed-burns-native-americans/}{that
needlessly restrict controlled burns}, or a refusal to punish arsonists.
It's Climate Change all the way down!

Like most woke \href{https://www.dictionary.com/browse/word-salad}{word
salads} this is questionable nonsense. The
\href{https://www.nifc.gov/index.html}{National Interagency Fire Center
(NIFC)}, a dull government agency located right here in Southern Idaho,
has been collecting wildfire burn statistics since the 1920s. Here's a
table of
\href{https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_totalFires.html}{wildfire
counts and acres burned since
1926}.\footnote{ I've downloaded and
  \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/notebooks/NationalFireData.txt}{archived
  this table}. I've observed that data has a tendency to disappear from
  public view when it's caught contradicting
  \href{https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pushing\%20a\%20false\%20narrative}{``the
  narrative.''}
} When you %\protect\hyperlink{fn1}{\textsuperscript{1}}
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/notebooks/wildfire\%20plot.ipynb}{plot
this data} you get Figure~\ref{fig:7007x0} on page~\pageref{fig:7007x0}.

\end{figure}

Oddly, more fires were burning more acres in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s
than today. Even with NIFC's caveat that data collected before 1983
``were not derived from the current situation reporting process'' and
``should not be compared to later data'' you're left wondering if
Climate Change is being framed while the real killer is still at large.

Dodging responsibility by blaming something completely out of your
control is a standard political gimmick.

``Hey man, this shit isn't on me!'', said every whining weasel ever.

For the sake of argument, assume we can \emph{instantly fix} Climate
Change. Let's wave our magical woke-wand and make all the bad emissions
go away. Here's a little question.

\begin{quote}
\emph{If greenhouse gas emissions are suddenly reduced to zero, how long
will it take to lower west coast wildfire frequency?}
\end{quote}

Want a clue? It may take decades to notice changes! If wildfires have to
wait for west coast \emph{wokerati} to fix Climate Change we're
going to be inhaling smoke for the rest of my life. I better order those
extra indoor air filters before the hoarders catch on.
