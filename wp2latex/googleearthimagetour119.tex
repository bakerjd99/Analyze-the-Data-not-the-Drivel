In a scientific poll of one, (I sampled myself),
\href{http://earth.google.com/}{Google Earth} was voted the greatest
free program on Earth. The brilliant developers at Google have managed
to turn the most unlikely subject, \emph{geography,} into a video game.
And what a game it is! Google Earth doesn't troll around in an
adolescent make believe world. Google Earth serves up the real thing.
This would be amazing enough but with Google Earth you can explore the
Moon, Mars and the night sky as well. If you have any \emph{geographic
or astronomical needs} get Google Earth.

I got into Google Earth a few years ago when I started
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging}{geotagging} old pictures.
Locating old, pre-GPS pictures, is one of the better Google Earth games.
My mother snapped this picture of me in 1964. I am standing in front of
the Uintah mountains in north eastern Utah.

1964 was long before GPS was even a dream. To find \emph{exactly} where
I was standing I turned on Google Earth's terrain feature and slowly
followed the adjacent road until all the landscape features matched up.

For famous sites it's not this hard. Here I am at Stonehenge. Stonehenge
is a Google Earth \emph{nobrainer}.

Over the last few years I have geotagged hundreds of images. It's
something I will continue to do until I drop dead. Online picture sites
like \href{http://www.smugmug.com/}{SmugMug} provide automatic mapping
of geotagged images but Google Earth does a much better job if you do a
little
\href{http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kml\_tut.html}{KML}
programming. KML is an XML namespace used by Google Earth and Google
Maps. It can be used to \emph{tour} geotagged images. When KML files are
compressed, (any ZIP utility will do), they are given a KMZ file
extension. KMZ files can be loaded by Google Earth.

The attached KMZ file
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/geotagged/geotagged.kmz}{\texttt{geotagged.kmz}} was generated
by a \href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/geotagged/kml.ijs}{J script} I put
together to query my geotagged SmugMug pictures. When loaded into Google
Earth it spins around the world pausing to display all the pictures I
have geotagged. I realize few will be interested in my pictures but it's
not hard to extract the KML embedded in \texttt{geotagged.kmz} and adapt
it to your pictures. Go forth and hack my friends.
