I've been refreshing my blog's look. I created new favicons,
blog-banners, and changed my WordPress theme to a simpler and more
modern style. I'd really like to harmonize my
\href{https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/}{picture} and blog sites, but
CSS issues are frustrating me. I have no desire to plunge into the CSS
blog sand, but if you care about online appearances it's hard to avoid.

The last time I changed my WordPress theme, I spent hours editing old
posts in an unsatisfactory effort to make them conform to the new theme.
Theoretically, you shouldn't have to do this. The whole point of a
\emph{theme} is to consolidate your visual style points into one easily
altered file. But, like many ``theories'', \emph{the one theme to rule
them all theory}, often fails when it comes up against complex blog
posts that harbor text-wrapped images, wonky tables, program code, \LaTeX\
fragments, \href{https://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter} extracts, and custom
HTML hacks.

Yeah, my blog is a mess!

I vowed I wouldn't edit old posts this time around. When you step in the
blog sand it's hard to get out, but I'm weak, lack restraint, and suffer
from a touch of \emph{perfectionism}. Still, in my defense, how could I
live with text surrounded by \texttt{ugly\ nontransparent} backgrounds?
So, once again, I jumped into the blog sand and thrashed
about\footnote{Blog sand is like quicksand in that the more you struggle the deeper
  you sink.}  trying to make the %\protect\hyperlink{fn1}{\textsuperscript{1}}
ugly go away.

\emph{The ugly will always be with us!}

If there is one take-away from my struggle it is this:

\Large
\begin{center}\textbf{Keep things simple stupid!}\end{center}
\normalsize

Complex typography is best practiced on paper/PDF. When composing blog
posts always choose the simplest style that works. If you eschew
flourishes the next time you change your theme, \emph{and there will be
a next time}, you won't sink as deeply into the blog sand.
