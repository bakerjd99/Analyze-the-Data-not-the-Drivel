Well, I survived 2021, another crappy COVID year. Three cheers for me.

2021 was marked by four deaths. The first off was my dad.
\href{https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2021/02/21/my-fathers-obituary/}{He
died in February} of ``general geriatric decline'' (old age) and I have
been dealing with his estate ever since. It's mostly settled with a few
irritating exceptions. Just try closing a joint saving account in
another country when both account holders are deceased. The frigging
\emph{Royal Bank of Canada}, yeah, I am naming names, has been trying to
paper-work me to death but they're tangling with the wrong cowboy. It's
now personal, I will keep at this, even though it's a small amount of
money, just to piss them off.~

A few months after dad's death my aunt Alberta Drake died. I wasn't
particularly close to Alberta, but it annoyed me that I learned of her
death second-hand. Later I learned, by inspecting her husband Bill's
grave in Livingston Montana, that my cousins did not bury Alberta beside
him. It's dead obvious, forgive the pun, that she wanted to be with
Bill. I would crawl over
\href{https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2020/09/08/new-study-shows-majority-of-blm-protests-turned-violent-n2575801}{BLM
riot} debris to honor my mother's wishes, but apparently, others feel
differently.

from recurring bouts of depression and spent much of her life Yo-Yo
dieting. However, for me, she was a fun aunt. Goodbye Alberta.}

\href{https://rogerhui.rip/}{Roger Hui} was the next to go. Roger was a
gifted programmer and a cocreator with
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson}{Ken Iverson} of
the \href{https://www.jsoftware.com/\#/}{J programming language}.~ I
knew and worked with Roger. He was my age, to the year, and, like me, a
graduate of the University of Alberta. I first heard of Roger when
interviewing for a job at I. P. Sharp Associates in Edmonton in the
early 1980's. My soon-to-be boss said Roger was the best coder he had
ever met. He was certainly among the best I've ever met. I use J almost
every day, so it's fair to say that Roger has impacted my thinking more
than most people on this planet. Roger died of cancer. I didn't know he
was ill, and his death bugged me more than I would have expected. Rest
in peace Roger.

The last to go was my ex-brother-in-law, Ian Dubin. ~Ian is the older
brother of my first wife Ruth Dubin. I met Ian in 1978. He came to
Barbados to attend our wedding. I liked him right from the start. Ian
was generous, smart, fun, and an all-around great guy, but he had a
nasty side. Like his father, he was an alcoholic. For many years the
drinking was just fun. God knows I didn't do anything to slow him down,
and looking back, my most memorable drunk ever was partly Ian's doing.~
When Ian's father died, he flew in from Hong Kong with a huge bottle of
Cognac. We met him at the Toronto airport and went to our hotel where we
drank until I was nearly comatose. The next day I puked up in the hearse
on the way to his dad's burial. Talk about making an impression on the
relatives! After the funeral, I learned that Ian, who drank far more
than me, didn't puke up anything and was largely functional. Drinking is
like everything; you get better with practice. As the years rolled on
the drinking slowly ruined and then claimed Ian's life. My last
interaction with Ian was another dispute about UFOs. He was a firm
believer in alien UFOs, predynastic Egyptian civilizations, and other
crank notions. You couldn't argue with him about his nutty beliefs
without angering him. Near the end, I just ignored certain topics. It's
always astonished me that intelligent well-educated people can believe
utter nonsense. Ian's UFO obsession was like
\href{https://brewminate.com/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-and-the-cottingly-fairies-hoax-of-1917-1921/}{Conan
Doyle's belief in fairies}: completely ridiculous to hard-ass skeptics
like me.~ We'll miss you, Ian. Thanks for many great times.

Aside from seeing off more people than usual in 2021, I also beavered
away on my little projects. I was foolish enough to publicly declare my
plans so let's go through my 2021 to-do list and eat some crow.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Update
  \href{https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/the-jod-page/}{JOD} to
  handle J's new direct definitions. \textbf{Finished}.
\item
  Print this blog as an ISBN'ed book. \textbf{I didn't even start this
  task.}
\item
  Write at least 50 blog posts. \textbf{Big miss!}
\item
  Upload at least 250 well-captioned images to my
  \href{https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/}{SmugMug} picture site. I
  didn't hit 250, but I came close enough. \textbf{Finished.}
\item
  Learn more about the RUST programming language and write some RUST
  binaries that can be called from J or Python. I did learn more about
  RUST but so far, no callable binaries. \textbf{Miss.}
\item
  Read at least twenty books. \textbf{Finished.}
\item
  Work through at least three \emph{math-intense} books. I read three
  math-intense books. I'm going to give myself this one.
  \textbf{Finished}.
\item
  Make another pass at learning and using
  \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/}{proof assistants like
  LEAN}. I have set up LEAN on a macOS machine and started using it. I
  still have much to learn, but I'm making steady progress.
  \textbf{Finished.}
\end{enumerate}

I managed five out of eight tasks: not particularly good or bad - C
student stuff.~I also achieved the last \emph{implied} item on my list:
\emph{stay alive}. In my next post, I will lay out my plans for 2022.
Restrain yourselves!
