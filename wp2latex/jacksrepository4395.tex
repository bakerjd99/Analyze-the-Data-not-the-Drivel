other day I attempted to browse a
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/geotagged/kml.ijs}{J
script} described in an
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/google-earth-image-touring/}{old
blog post} only to find that my employer's network monkeys had blocked
the \href{https://app.box.com/}{file sharing service}. I've railed about
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/06/09/controlling-cell-phones-the-new-it-frontier/}{IT
control freaks} in the past. They will not rest until it's impossible to
do useful work. I fumed and grumbled until I perceived a bigger problem.
I have so many references to program code in this blog that it's getting
tedious tracking them down. Wouldn't it be nice if my hacks were neatly
organized in one coherent repository?

Let me introduce
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks}{\texttt{jacks}}.
\texttt{jacks}, or ``J-hacks'', organizes the
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks}{J related code referenced in
this blog} into a single
\href{https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks}{GitHub} repository. Most of
the scripts in \texttt{jacks} are one-offs but some have
\href{http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/wordpress-to-latex-with-pandoc-and-j-using-texfrwpxml-ijs-part-3/}{proven
so useful} that it makes sense to store them in a repository and track
changes. From now on \texttt{jacks} will be the first place to look for
code from this blog. You pull the contents of \texttt{jacks} into a new
Git repository with the commands:

%{[}code light=``true'' language=``bash''{]}

\begin{verbatim}
git init
git remote add jacks https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks.git
git pull jacks master
\end{verbatim}

%{[}/code{]}

It took me a few moments to settle on the name ``jacks.'' I considered
``jokes'' because programmers often take their code too seriously and
``jocks'' because J programmers are wild out of control convention
eschewing code jocks but \texttt{jacks} won out when I remembered the
refrain ``jack be nimble, jack be quick, jack jump over'' \emph{whatever
coding problem is pissing you off.}
