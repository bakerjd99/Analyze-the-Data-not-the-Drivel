These files divide into two classes: *plumbing* and *content.* Plumbing
consists of `LaTeX` preambles, style files, shell scripts and other files
used to build and format content. Feel free to copy, adapt and tweak
the plumbing. Content consists of the *actual blog post text*. Content
is copyrighted and I shouldn't have to remind you that ripping off
the written work of others is just plain rude. Besides, do you really
want to be guilty of plagiarizing my blog?

If you don't want to wade through hundreds of `LaTeX` files
you can download a complete consolidated `pdf` version of my 
blog by following links on this page [Download this Blog](https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/download-this-blog/)
or by [clicking here.](https://bakerjd99.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/bm.pdf)

The same large PDF file is 
available in [this repository here.](https://github.com/bakerjd99/Analyze-the-Data-not-the-Drivel/blob/master/wp2latex/bm.pdf)
**Warning**: GitHub does not handle rendering of large PDF files well (April 2017).  If you use this
link download the file and ignore the ever spinning busy circle.
