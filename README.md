===============================================================

This repository holds `LaTeX` and `Markdown` versions of my blog
[Analyze the Data not the Drivel](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/).
For details see the blog posts:

1. [WordPress to LaTeX with Pandoc 
and J: Prerequisites (Part 1)](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/02/11/wordpress-to-latex-with-pandoc-and-j-prerequisites-part-1/)

2. [WordPress to LaTeX with Pandoc

3. [WordPress to LaTeX with Pandoc 
and J: Using TeXfrWpxml.ijs (Part 3)](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/wordpress-to-latex-with-pandoc-and-j-using-texfrwpxml-ijs-part-3/)

4. [Turn your Blog into an eBook](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/turn-your-blog-into-an-ebook/)

These files divide into two classes: *plumbing* and *content.* Plumbing
consists of `LaTeX` preambles, style files, shell scripts and other files
used to build and format content. Feel free to copy, adapt and tweak
the plumbing. Content consists of the *actual blog post text*. Content
is copyrighted and I shouldn't have to remind you that ripping off
the written work of others is just plain rude. Besides, do you really
want to be guilty of plagiarizing my blog?

If you don't want to wade through hundreds of `LaTeX` files
you can download a complete consolidated `pdf` version of my 
blog by [clicking here.](https://app.box.com/s/8yvm27ag9agtm32nfahd)
