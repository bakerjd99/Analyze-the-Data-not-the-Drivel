![](adndsymsmall.png) [TODO](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/)
===============================================================

Pending and considered changes for [Analyze the Data not the Drivel](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/)
source files.

The base 36 GUID key is stable over the lifetime of a task. 

Note: I use a number of Version Control Systems (VCS). The base 36 GUID
is my key for relating issues, tickets and so forth across systems.

`[begin-todo]`

1. `<_a7oj485zhjesdbgecyjvtfqvc_>` Add verb to `TeXfrWpxml.ijs` to insert yearly post count in `bm.tex`.

2. `<_vacf0rik3kyvhphf9gw3sa51_>` Continue shortening and revising captions displayed in the list of figures.

3. `<_7t5z8mzamsru31xcpm2h1me69_>` Consider adding PDF internal cross references to previous blog posts.
   Currently all such references point online.

4. `<_2u83zfr6pcghzx21yjjqm7rvk_>` Standardize syntax colors for  `lstlisting` and `pandoc/pygments`. Source code
   is displayed with two packages and there are good reasons to use both.

5. `<_22sy2a81cibs5h3p58ddwd2mk_>` Extract all source code into jupyter notebooks. jupyter's LaTeX output does a very
   good jod of formatting J and other types of code. This would be a third way of formatting code.

6. `<_cbwcaloj3hsqz1t1hr4346zio_>` Standardize source code fonts for `lstlisting` and `pandoc/pygments`.

7. `<_1lcv2mj4m3jhmqnmx0dm0407d_>` Make sure there are no font substitutions for PDF versions.
   This may require the installation of fonts.

8. `<_0rcowpb3vtoukbriwjqhuf906_>` Add an appendix to the PDF version that exposes all internal URLs.

9.  `<_b40i9ac9s7a27oaq638qcx9fl_>` Start work on building PDF overall index, list of figures, tables so forth.

10.  `<_dyemvqi0zwbcr1rgzdvup2mg4_>` Start work on changing the PDF document geometry to match a standard book size.

11. `<_dbuneq7zihz4o5g2v2iu80dky_>` Continue redirecting all code links from [box.com](https://www.box.com/)
   and [box.net](https://www.net.com/) to [github.com/bakerjd99](https://github.com/bakerjd99). Also hunt
   down references to old Google Documents and redirect.

12.  `<_6vzptk3mizfci8xhku2zqph0n_>` For selected posts create updated PDF versions.

13. `<_5u5iygqpeea7oict0qabc0g4k_>` Standardize image link text in markdown version.

14.  `<_08864qa8dtrsnn3v7cjrqsfjn_>` Revise cover graphics for eBook and PDF versions.

`[end-todo]`
