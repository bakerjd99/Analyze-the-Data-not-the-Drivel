Lately I have been amusing myself by working through [Euclid’s
Elements.](https://www.amazon.com/Euclids-Elements-T-L-Heath-Translation/dp/1888009195/ref=pd\_sim\_b\_4)
Despite studying mathematics in university, teaching it in high school
and *occasionally* using it in my software-soaked day job I never got
around to reading Euclid.

Euclid is routinely lionized as the wellspring of axiomatic mathematics.
Before *The Elements* mathematicians were *clearly* out of control! They
were running around developing useful methods, (counting, fractions,
roots), and *– gasp – making unjustified assertions!*

Fortunately, *The Elements* put an end to all that and ushered in the
endless age of rigorous axiomatic mathematics. I admire mathematical
rigor but my tiny brain can only take so much of it before an
all-pervading fog of befuddlement sets in. When I’m all fogged up there
are only a few options:

1.  Reread and rework until the fog clears.

2.  Press on and review later.

3.  Give up and abase self.

4.  Take a break.

I’m a lazy
[S.O.B.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=S.O.B.) so
option (4), take a break, comes up more often than it should. One of my
favorite ways to break away from mathematics is to read about it’s
*long* history. While tracing the history of *The Elements* I came
across the writings of [C. K. Raju.](https://ckraju.net/index.html)

C. K. Raju has written a fascinating book: (the) [Cultural Foundations
of Mathematics: The Nature of Mathematical Proof and the Transmission of
the Calculus from India to Europe in the 16th c.
CE.](https://books.google.com/books?id=jza\_cNJM6fAC\&pg=PA379\&lpg=PA379\&dq=C.+K.+Raju+Criticism\&source=bl\&ots=HEEAXlWhtW\&sig=7n3w6VnpLlYx2rQIMq7Lsa9uOcc\&hl=en\&ei=YY9hTNCvFMKBlAfdmcmLCw\&sa=X\&oi=book\_result\&ct=result\&resnum=5\&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage\&q\&f=false)
Raju’s book is a bit hard to get your hands on. It’s not on Amazon but
you can use [World Cat](https://www.worldcat.org/) to find a copy near
you.

Raju’s thesis consist of these major points:

1.  Significant portions of the *calculus* developed in India long
    before [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac\_Newton) and
    [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried\_Leibniz) and
    Indian methods, particularly series expansions, came into Europe via
    16th century Jesuit missionaries.

2.  European notions of rigorous mathematical proof evolved from the
    needs of the Catholic Church to convert Muslims with *impressive*
    iron-clad logical arguments. The old [baffle them with
    bullshit](https://writing2.richmond.edu/training/383/383restricted/bullshit.pdf)
    tactic. Raju claims this *theological* attitude worked it’s way into
    mathematics and resulted in the *bizarre western view* that
    deduction is superior to observation, experience and induction.

3.  The ultimate source of eastern secular knowledge, (mostly Arab and
    Indian), was systematically suppressed and “Hellenized” by the
    Catholic Church. The church claimed all the “good stuff” in Arab
    texts originated with the ancient Greeks and had been *merely
    preserved by Arab copycats.* It just wouldn’t do to credit hated,
    (remember the crusades), enemies for their good ideas.

4.  Insisting on rigorous proof when teaching mathematics, especially to
    children, is sterile and stupid.

All of this reads like a mathematical [Dan
Brown](https://www.danbrown.com/#/home) novel and oddly the Catholic
Church is once again the villain. I was enjoying Raju’s account until
this passage about
[Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes\_Kepler):

> *Why, after all, was
> [Tycho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho\_Brahe) so secretive about
> his papers, not even allowing his trusted assistant Kepler to see
> them? In any case, on Tycho’s sudden death, Kepler obtained not just
> Tycho’s observations but also the rest of his papers which contained
> the underlying theory. Being inclined towards heliocentrism, Kepler
> transformed
> [Nilakantha’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha\_Somayaji)
> “Tychonic” orbits to a heliocentric frame (a simple transformation).
> This made Nilakantha’s variable epicycles come out as ellipses. Being
> a professional astrologer, Kepler was good at making up stories, and
> he made up the story about how he had arrived at his results using
> Tycho’s data.*

In other words Kepler is a fraud and he ripped off one of the major
discoveries in astronomy, the elliptical orbits of planets, from Indian
astronomers. It’s one thing to spin plausible stories about how parts of
calculus may have seeped into Europe from unacknowledged sources it’s
another thing to posthumously accuse someone of fraud.

What would it take to make Raju’s case? *How about some hard evidence!*
What about Tycho’s secret papers, do any of these documents survive and
do they contain references to Nilakantha? Now that would be a smoking
gun. Of course we don’t know of any such papers *but that doesn’t mean
they didn’t exist.* Proof by conspiracy is a very powerful inference
rule — [9/11
troofers](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=troofer) and
[ufologists](https://mw4.m-w.com/dictionary/ufologist) swear by it! What
about the claim that the transformation from Nilakantha’s variable
epicycle **Earth centered system** to a **Sun centered** elliptical
orbit system is “a simple transformation.” I rather doubt it’s as simple
as claimed and even if the transformation was, to use the most abused
word in mathematics — *trivial*, it still misses the point. The major
shift was to abandon all pretense of **Earth centered systems** no
matter how mathematically sophisticated! Before Kepler astronomers and
mathematicians, in many cultures, toyed with the idea that planets orbit
the sun. After Kepler everyone had to grow up. Planets do orbit the sun
deal with it!

And it was precisely how Newton dealt with it that made calculus
something worth fighting over. Newton’s unprecedented and monumental
proof that elliptical orbits are a mathematical consequence off the
inverse square law of gravity is the dividing line between modern and
early science. Nothing like it had ever been done before and even today
physics and mathematics students are given to chanting [we are not
worthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FucbvoFFy0) when presented with
this brilliant argument. Without Newton’s use of the calculus nobody but
a few anal mathematicians would give a rat’s ass about who invented
calculus.

In a later post I will argue that Raju discounts the importance of
independent and coequal mathematical discovery in his account.
