Before my fall I launched a PIP (Perpetual Impossible Project). PIPs are
long-range risky undertakings that cannot be finished. PIPs contradict
and subvert the very notion of tightly controlled corporate style
projects: hence their manifest appeal to recusants like myself.

I won’t go into details about my particular PIP. Let’s just say it
captures every delusional notion I have ever entertained. Part of my
project involved installing a few Proof Assistants. Proof assistants are
programs that [verify formal mathematical
proofs.](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) There are many proof assistant
programs available. These programs are not mathematical magic bullets.
They don’t prove theorems and they don’t make the job of “theorem
proving” easier. To use a programming analogy: a traditional proof is
like [pseudo code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) while a
formal proof is like an [assembly
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly\_language) program. If
you have ever written a nontrivial assembly language program you have
some idea of the sheer effort required to produce a formal proof.

*So, if formal proof only makes mathematics more difficult, why bother?
This is like asking, so if implementing pseudo code only makes
programming more difficult, why bother?*
