*Posted: 12 Jan 2021 23:28:42*

We all have our New Year’s traditions. One of mine is trying out
*new*[^7048x1] image editors and reevaluating older familiar editors that
I’ve put aside. This year I looked at three editors.

1.  [Luminar AI](https://skylum.com/luminar/luminar-ai)

2.  [Picture Window Pro 8](https://www.dl-c.com/Downloads.html)

3.  [GNU GIMP 2.10.22](https://www.gimp.org/)

#### Luminar AI

Let’s start with [Luminar AI](https://skylum.com/luminar/luminar-ai).
Luminar AI makes the possibly true claim that it’s the first
commercially available “AI-Driven” image editor. Whenever *salespeople*
concatenate qualifying phrases set your [bullshit detector to
eleven](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spinal+tap+set+to+11&t=brave&iax=videos&ia=videos&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF7IZZXQ89Oc)
and proceed skeptically.

To start, the entire field of “Machine Learning,” and all its little
subdisciplines like “AI image processing,” are horribly misnamed.
[XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) pointed this out in this pithy cartoon.

I don’t know what you should call the many relatively novel image
processing algorithms found in products like Luminar AI but calling them
“intelligent” completely misses the mark.

> *Only conscious and self-aware entities can be considered
> intelligent.*

Luminar AI is not self-aware — thank the [all squiggly
FSM](https://www.spaghettimonster.org/) for that — I wouldn’t want it in
my house if it was!

Lucky for Luminar AI the only thing I ask of image editors is, “do they
help me edit images?” In Luminar’s case, the answer is a *resounding*
yes!

I’m a Luminar AI newbie but I already appreciate how it’s simplified
some tedious editing tasks like sky replacement. Consider my *boring
light* shot of the Devil’s Tower in Wyoming. 

[Image link: Boring Light Devil's Tower](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/Trips/USA-and-Canada/Western-Road-Trip-2015/i-Dq2KDP4/A)

To replace the dull sky in this shot I’d generate a mask based on sky
color and then tweak the boundary to avoid including tower and tree
parts. *Tweaking masks and selections is a time-consuming pain.* Luminar
AI eliminates the drudgery, pushing a few buttons yields this jazzed up
shot.

Sky replacement has a long pedigree in photography. The practice started
with 19^th^-century landscape photographers. They made *film* by mixing
chemicals and spreading the mixture, called an *emulsion*, on large
glass plates. Plate emulsions were very slow, (would you believe an
[effective ASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed) below four?),
and [“disproportionately sensitive to blue and violet light, resulting
almost always in overexposed
skies.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/arts/design/faking-it-at-the-met-a-photography-exhibition.html)
To fix their washed-out skies[^7048x2] 19^th^-century photographers resorted
to darkroom trickery. Luminar AI has greatly streamlined this old image
hack.

There’s more to Luminar AI than sky replacement. I’ve found its portrait
and face manipulation features useful. The program does a very good job
of isolating eyes in images. Consider this diptych of a boy holding
dollars.

The original, on the left, has dark pit eyes. The Luminar AI version on
the right has enlarged fake eyes and model smooth skin. You wouldn’t
normally push pixels this hard but sometimes a little eye and skin
tuning can make a portrait pop. I’ve only used Luminar AI for a few
weeks but it’s already earned a spot on my image tools team.

#### Picture Window Pro 8

My next editor, [Picture Window Pro
8](https://www.dl-c.com/Downloads.html), is a new version of what I have
long considered the “best bang for your buck” image editor out there. I
found Picture Window Pro back in 2003. I was looking for an inexpensive
editor that could handle 16-bit channel images. Photoshop Elements, my
second image editor, only supported 8-bit images and full Photoshop was
way too expensive.[^7048x3] Adobe’s larceny drove me to Picture Window Pro
(PWP) but once I there I never looked back. PWP was much faster and more
memory efficient than Photoshop and it’s many competitors. Traits that
it maintains to this day. In 2021 it’s still the fastest loading editor
I use.

I stuck with Picture Window Pro from 2003 to 2017, longer than most
marriages. But, in 2017 Jonathan Sachs, the gifted developer of PWP,
decided to retire the program. It was PWP’s retirement that led me to
start trying out new image editors every year. My first post PWP editor
was [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/). Affinity
Photo is a fine tool that I use all the time, [see my review
here](https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2017/01/22/affinity-photo-review/),
but I missed PWP. So I was delighted when Picture Window Pro 8 emerged.

Picture Window Pro 8 (PWP8) has revamped the older program for modern
large displays. You can now scatter PWP8 windows all over your giant
monitor. The program has also introduced a well considered
transformation history feature that makes it easy to track and reproduce
long edit chains.

And, if you thought PWP delivered bang for the buck, PWP8 takes it to a
new level. PWP8 is free for personal and commercial use. The developers
ask you to make a small PayPal donation: a fee I gladly paid. High
quality free is a killer combination! If you edit images on Windows
machines you owe it to yourself to get PWP8.

#### GNU GIMP 2.10.22

[GNU GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), or “The GIMP,” as its affectionately
known, is a venerable open source system that’s undergone major upgrades
in recent years. The most significant change has been the edition of
high bit channel support. The GIMP now supports 16-bit channels and new
high bit image formats like
[HEIC](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/what-is-heic-3660408/). This
puts the GIMP on par with commercial editors.

I’ve always liked the GIMP’s vast potpourri of image hacking addins. You
can tell that few marketers and product designers were involved in their
development. Some guy, and let’s be honest ladies it was probably a guy,
had an image edit itch and cranked out a GIMP addin to scratch it. This
explains the existence of, “nobody asked for that,” tools like mapping
images onto cubes and cylinders.

The GIMP is fun, sprawling, capable, comprehensive, idiosyncratic, and
free: really free! If you’re so inclined you can fetch [GIMP source
code](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp) and build your own version.
Sadly, this freedom has been abused. A fragile *wokester* that
considered the word “GIMP,” which stands for **G**NU **I**mage
**M**anipulation **P**rogram, *ableist*[^7048x4] has [forked The GIMP and
built a renamed
version](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2019/08/28/developer-forks-gimp-image-editor-over-naughty-name/)
that supposedly won’t melt effeminate snowflakes. **I am completely fed
up with *wokespeak*; I will always call The GIMP “The GIMP” and so
should you!**

[^7048x1]: New to me!

[^7048x2]: Hacking skies in paintings probably goes way back to cave and rock
    artists.

[^7048x3]: Some things never change, in 2021 Photoshop is still too expensive
    and now you are forced to *subscribe* to it.

[^7048x4]: We can be thankful it still *identifies* as a program!
