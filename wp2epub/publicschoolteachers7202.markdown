One of the many positive things to emerge from the Coronavirus pandemic
is the renewed interest of parents in just what the fuck is going on in
their children's schools. Like many pandemic perks this wasn't planned,
but when kids were expelled from their classrooms and parents were sent
home from their jobs, both ended up staring into the ugly
[Zoomed](https://zoom.us/) abyss of public education. It's safe to say
many did not like what they saw!

First, we had inane, *over-the-top-reactions*, to what some
"teachers"[^7202x1] saw in the bedrooms of their students. [Imagine getting
suspended over a toy gun in the
background](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/us/student-suspended-gun-virtual/index.html)
of a video call. Then the usual suspects chimed in with earnest screeds
about how [students aren't showing
up](https://www.the74million.org/article/how-missing-zoom-classes-could-funnel-kids-into-the-juvenile-justice-system-and-why-some-experts-say-now-is-the-time-to-reform-truancy-rules/).
Maybe hectoring over Zoom backgrounds wasn't such a good idea! Nah!
Finally, teachers zeroed in on important issues like should students [be
allowed to wear pajamas during Zoom
lessons?](https://www.smartclassroommanagement.com/2020/08/22/students-pajamas-zoom-lessons/)
When parents dared question this nonsense they were harassed on
*Twatter* and *FarceBook*.[^7202x2] *Jesus Christopher Christ and Mohammed
blowing Buddha in a mud bath!* It's like public school teachers and
administrators were going out of their way to affirm our low opinion of
them.[^7202x3]

As bad as U.S. public education was in the late *paleoboomer* era (the
1970s), it's clearly gotten worse. Schools at all levels, are carrying
[appalling loads of parasitic
administrators](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/higher-ed-administrators-growth_n_4738584).
To be fair a lot of the administrative bullshit schools deal with has
been imposed by government dickheads. Still, it remains absolutely true
that schools are no more difficult to manage today than they were a
century ago, but boy do we waste far more time and money administering
them. We should recoil at such waste but remember, it's good for the
union parasites and other bottom-feeding underachievers that infest
public schools. I mean, what would these people do? They'd immediately
have to camp with the rest of the *useless unhoused.*[^7202x4]

All the trivial demeaning pseudo-academic rot in public schools might
have remained safely under the fat-ass-public's radar but pandemic Zoom
shoved it in their faces. Suddenly, even disinterested, *we don't give a
shit about our children's education,* parents started wondering about
the crap being "taught" in schools. As ghastly as much of this was, it
was CRT that really woke up the non-woke!

I am not going to get into CRT. Even in its most austere and respected
academic form, it's nothing more than another foul product of *garbage
academia.* Its luminaries are, at best, mediocre scholars[^7202x5], and the
"theory" is a simple observation that the dominant majority group in
society tends to structure society to serve their interests. *Well,
golly fucking duh!*

Yes, the U.S. is largely a society that favors whites just like Japan is
a society that largely favors Asians and Nigeria is a society that
largely favors blacks. Dominant group supremacy is a pernicious and
persistent feature of *all* human societies. This is not a uniquely
white failing; it's a human failing. Rarified CRT, the theory that's
[not taught in public
schools](https://dailycaller.com/2021/07/29/critical-race-theory-law-school-antiracism/),
implicitly concedes this point but the dumbed-down version[^7202x6] that's
crept into schools and alarmed parents basically blames whitey for all
the bad shit and demands reparations.

> **I don't give a crap about CRT, or the people bitching about CRT, but
> I care a lot about the accountability of public institutions.**

Public schools are public institutions; it's right in the damn name!
What goes on in public schools should be fully open to the public. You
should be able to hop on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and
quickly lookup exhaustive lists of all the workbooks, textbooks,
software, and other curriculum materials used in any school nationwide.
You should also be able to pull up course syllabi; i.e.Â what the hell
are teachers planning to teach, for any public school course anywhere.

Here's a little homework assignment for you. Go look up the history
textbooks (if any) used for 9^th^ graders in your school district. How
about 5^th^-grade math workbooks? If you're lucky you might find a few
references but for most school districts you'll pull up what database
people call a big fat null. Also called nada, zip, or pound sand peon!
As most school districts are dripping in under-employed administrators
you might think they might post a few curriculums. Nah! Basically, our
so-called public schools don't give a crap about public accountability.

This all came to a head in what's turning out to be another David versus
Goliath court case over, would you believe it, curriculum materials. It
all started with a Rhode Island mother making [a simple request for CRT
curriculum
materials](https://nypost.com/2021/08/05/teachers-union-sues-mom-over-requests-for-crt-curriculum-info/).
She wanted to know if her child was being taught CRT. What an affront!
I'm pretty sure if she had asked about geometry the school would have
happily coughed up materials, but CRT is too important to allow mere
parents to interfere. The school system declared the nuisance mom a
bitchy ["Karen"](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/karen/) and advised
fornicating elsewhere. Then the [NEA](https://www.nea.org/) piled on,
and it's off to the courts to litigate another total bullshit case.

Here's my suggestion to curb this crap. Many cops are now required to
wear body cameras to hold them accountable when they abuse their
authority. Public school teachers should also be required to wear body
cameras. If every teacher knew that their dodgy behavior and
off-curriculum rants might be splashed all over the Internet they might
drop the drivel and get back to, I don't know, actual school lessons!

[^7202x1]: The intellectual pygmy that phoned this in reminded all of us just
    how awful some public school teachers are. Can we please just fire
    some of these dipshits?

[^7202x2]: I will never utter the *preferred names* of these social network
    abominations again!

[^7202x3]: In my university days, anyone pursuing an "Education Degree" was
    dismissed as an intellectual lightweight.

[^7202x4]: The "homeless" are now to be called "unhoused." Apparently, the
    word "homeless" acquired a negative connotation. Maybe it had
    something to do with observing the "unhoused."

[^7202x5]: CRT is so frivolous that even the Nobel Peace Prize committee
    won't touch it.

[^7202x6]: Pretty much anything taught in U.S. public schools nowadays is
    dumbed down.
