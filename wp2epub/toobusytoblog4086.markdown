Blogging is like going to the gym. You tell yourself you’re going to do
it everyday and then you don’t. The last two months have been all about
my [mother’s
death](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/evelyns-eulogy/) and
work. Any remaining hours were siphoned off by my other hobbies:
photography and reading. Yeah I count reading as a hobby.

If we’re going to have the long happy writer-reader relationship that
we’re all looking for you are going to have to put up with my ticks. I
will enumerate them for you:

1.  **I blow hot and cold on things.** I am either all in or all out. If
    I am blogging that’s pretty much all I am doing. If I am taking
    pictures or programming that’s pretty much it. Balance is for rocks
    on pinnacles not me.

2.  **I always return to my passions.** I never give up on things I just
    put them aside. My affection for amateur astronomy has not gone away
    it’s just difficult to indulge it in the wretched quasi-opaque low
    altitude skies of St. Louis. This city has many charms but clear
    skies is not one of them.

3.  **I don’t give a crap about what people think.** This is a problem
    for anyone that pretends to write. Authors, even lowly bloggers,
    cannot ignore their audience or they won’t have one. My manly
    impulse is to ignore you, but I will, on occasion, profusely
    apologize and beg you to keep reading. It’s all crocodile tears. My
    apologies are as insincere as Obama’s: another guy that doesn’t give
    a crap about what you think.

4.  **I will never change: at least while alive.** Guys get this
    instantly. A few women have vainly tried to correct my bad habits;
    they didn’t succeed.

To end June on a happy note and, more importantly, to test a nifty
WordPress layout feature here’s a collection of recent images. All these
images, and thousands more, [are always on view on
SmugMug](http://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/). Next month I will be a
better boy and write the epoch defaming rubbish you all love and crave.
