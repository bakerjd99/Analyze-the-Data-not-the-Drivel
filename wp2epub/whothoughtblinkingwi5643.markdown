One night, a few weeks ago, I was driving west on I86 near American
Falls when I spotted a long string of blinking red lights. The lights
stretched over a large arc of the horizon. My first thought was “Jesus
H. Christ now what?” As an amateur astronomer, I have climbed mountains
to get away from light pollution. Now some [jackwagon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jack%20wagon) was ruining an
entire rural horizon with a goddamn string of synchronized windfarm
lights.

May I ask why?

Windfarms blink at night to warn planes they’re flying to low. Please!
The towers are well under 100 meters. If you are flying a plane below
100 meters in mountainous locales like Idaho you have far more serious
problems than running into wind turbines. This is another example of
stupid regulation. There is absolutely no good reason for lighting up
entire landscapes. It wrecks the view, distracts drivers, (cars on I86
were slowing down to get a better view), wastes energy, rapes the night
sky, and reminds everyone what an environmental tax-subsidized eye sore
windfarms are. Don’t even think of disagreeing. When was the last time
you looked at a landscape littered with wind turbines and thought, “This
is so much better than it was before.”

Yes, I know windfarms are saving us from global warming. If you believe
that you are probably exactly the type of person that signed off on
ruining an entire county’s nighttime view with goddamn blinking
windfarms.
