Writing a blog that only spambots peruse affords unlimited editorial
freedom. Without readers to offend I am at liberty to blither on about
whatever holds my attention. And today, while sitting with pen in hand
and listening to soft rain fall, my attention is held, not by the war in
Ukraine, or the January 6th "insurrection" hearings, or the interminable
US gun control debate, or grotesque groomer travesties, or rampaging
inflation[^7354x1] or social, *give me a frigging break*, justice! No, what's
commandeering my cortex is the Internet Light Bulb.

When I first saw Internet Light Bulbs a few pandemics ago I dismissed
them as another inane unnecessary frivolity: an LED *Twatter*[^7354x2] if you
will. Do we really need to control the color and intensity of our light
bulbs with a phone app? If you think the answer to this question is
"Yes," please adjust your meds. Adding to their absurdity, early
Internet Light Bulbs were also ridiculously expensive. Two WiFi bulbs
could set you back one hundred bucks. WTF? Well, technology marches on,
(at least for the important things), and now you can pick up a pair of
WiFi bulbs for about ten bucks: not much more than ordinary LEDs.

In inflationary times it doesn't make sense to hold shrinking cash. So
I'm blaming Joe (Brandon) Biden and brown vagina Kamala Harris for my
inability to resist WiFi light bulbs.[^7354x3] I traded a few ever-shrinking
dollars for sparkly new Internet Light Bulbs and they are easily the
most useless things I own.

Not only are they magnificently useless they're also bringing old light
bulb jokes to life. Have you ever read a manual on light bulb
installation? Until yesterday I hadn't. While I was hooking the bulbs
into our home network, I couldn't believe I was providing tech support
for light bulbs! When my bulbs were configured, and all the necessary
software was installed, I was finally able to turn them on, and wait for
it, adjust their hue and intensity. If you've suspected that we are
living in a "techadent age,"[^7354x4] well, the Internet Light Bulb is its
standard candle.

[^7354x1]: Hey Joe, you demented moron, Milton Friedman [is still very much
    in
    charge](https://www.wsj.com/articles/milton-friedman-biden-spending-inflation-free-market-carter-afghanistan-southern-border-11637014161)
    when it comes to inflation!

[^7354x2]: I don't refer to social network abominations by name.

[^7354x3]: Blaming others for your bad choices isn't only for BIPOCs, POWs
    (People of White), can also play that game.

[^7354x4]: *Techadent:* the application of advanced technology to decadent
    and frivolous things.
