Last weekend I passed through Toronto. The city was bracing for the
[over
priced](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37901237/ns/world\_news-americas/)
and [utterly pointless G20 dog and pony
show](https://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2010/06/25/pointless-g-20-summit-unfolds-in-toronto/).
The G20 circus did not disappoint. On cue the usual crew of
[recreational
anarchists](https://www.calgarysun.com/news/g20/2010/06/28/14549321.html)
left their parents basements long enough to engage the police, set cars
on fire and smash store windows. The police responded by arresting
hundreds of protestors and holding them *for hours in horrific detention
facilities that [did not offer vegan
food!](https://torontoist.com/2010/06/g20\_dispatches\_everyone\_loses.php)*
Hey, it’s Canada, a gluten-free diet is probably enshrined somewhere in
the [Charter of Rights and
Freedoms.](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/)

Mirroring the idiocy in the streets the G20 leaders wasted tax dollars
in grand style by [literally phoning one in for the
children](https://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2010/06/29/roundup-promises-protestors-promoting-maternal-child-health).
They also muttered something about [reducing government
debt](https://nbbusinessjournal.canadaeast.com/front/article/1114209) and
doing a better job of pretending to be fiscally sane. Hey G20! I have a
suggestion for that debt reduction thing — how about no more G20
meetings! Video conferencing software does a pretty good job; give it a
try!

Given the pitiful track record and high costs of the G20 one wonders why
any sane country would host such a boondoggle. Nothing of importance is
ever achieved at these photo-ops and if something worthwhile accidently
emerges it will be [ignored or
sabotaged.](https://www.globaltradealert.org/gta-analysis/broken-promises-g20-summit-report-global-trade-alert)
I know it’s good for our rulers to get out and meet with their peers:
[all work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgMdz2fe0CY). Still it’s hard, in
ostensibly democratic countries like Canada, to sell the public on the
awesome benefits of hosting the G20. *Do you remember how the Canadian
public refused to fund the G20 when asked in the pre-conference
referendum?* Oops sorry, I was thinking of how things should work!
Nobody ever asks the public if they want to pay because the answer would
be a resounding no.

The G20 is coveted, courted and consummated for exactly the same reason
that more expensive boondoggles like the Olympics and the World Cup are:
it’s a great opportunity to [punt public funds to your
friends.](https://www.nationalpost.com/Clement+riding+stuffed+with+cash+Liberals/3163957/story.html)
