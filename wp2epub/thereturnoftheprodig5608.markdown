It’s been ages since my last blog post. Yes, I’ve been a very, very bad
blogger. Lesser men would throw themselves on the metaphorical feet of
their readers and beg for forgiveness but if you’re expecting apologies
you don’t know me! I write for myself; if you choose to read my
ramblings, well that’s on you.

Since my last entry I have:

1.  *Retired*. I finally pulled the plug on being a *so-called
    productive member of society*. Now I’m an old Social Security
    draining parasite. *Since I no longer pay net taxes I am effectively
    dead to the state and they would love it if I was actually dead.*
    Dead people are easier to finance. Unfortunately, I’ve always been
    on to the deep state and my new mission in life is to claw back
    every single tax dollar I ever paid with butt loads of interest.
    When I snuff off this mortal coil I am going stick you with a giant
    uncollectable I OWE FUCKING YOU! If you create financially
    unsustainable systems that encourage abuse, well guess what, you’re
    going to get abused. God, I’m loving being a bitter old man; it’s
    what I was born to be.

2.  [*Continued to pursue my hobbies, especially photography.*](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/)
    This year (2019) I set the mini-goals of shooting, on average, one
    picture per day and scanning at least three hundred prints
    and slides. This may not sound like a lot but it takes *me* time to
    select the best images, process RAW files, restore film scans, edit
    or hack pictures, write captions and [compute keywords](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bakerjd99/smugpyter/blob/master/notebooks/Setting%20SmugMug%20Print%20Size%20and%20Geotag%20Keywords%20with%20Jupyter%20and%20Python.ipynb).
    I treat every uploaded image as a *milliblogging* opportunity. Some
    of my image captions are longer than some of my blog posts.

3.  *Taken on some new family responsibilities and obligations*.

4.  *Taken some trips*.

5.  [*Worked on various personal software
    projects*.](https://github.com/bakerjd99/smugpyter)

[Arthur C. Clarke](https://www.clarkefoundation.org/) once remarked that
only unimaginative people get bored. I’ve always had something on my
mind and I’ve always lived in my head. This has always been my problem
and my strength. With retirement, I am casting off my shriveled shackles
of pretense. I’m not even going to pretend to care about other people’s
problems. I will think about what I find fascinating and do what I find
worthwhile.

*Call it retirement privilege snowflakes!*

Now get back to work and pay your taxes you have old parasites to
support.
