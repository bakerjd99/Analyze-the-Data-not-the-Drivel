Bad news philosophers, our preeminent social critic, our font of wisdom,
our modern Socrates has succumbed to the malignant Hollywood poisons of
[reality TV](http://www.youjustmademylist.com/?p=562), [celebrity
whoring](http://www.spike.com/articles/0xugni/the-top-10-whore-rific-female-celebrities),
[financial
ennui](http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/09/scant-improvement-in-nations.html)
and [hopeless incompetent governance](http://www.whitehouse.gov/). Given
the forces arrayed against our philosopher king only Vegas bookies on
crack would favor his chances. I knew all this when I sat down to view
the latest [Conan the
Barbarian](http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi3994852377/) movie but
I let hope trump reason — sound familiar. If I wasn’t a
[mainly-manly-man](http://staff.rio.edu/miket/attitude.htm) I would cry
for no longer will we ponder religious dissertations like:

> *Crom! I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No
> one, not even you, will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we
> fought, or why we died. All that matters is that today, two stood
> against many. That’s what’s important! Valor pleases you, Crom; so
> grant me this one request. Grant me revenge! **And if you do not
> listen, then to hell with you!***

My friends that golden Apollonic age is past! Now we must content
ourselves with [Eat, Pray,
Love](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/binge-pretend-boink/)
travesties like:

> *I live, I love, I slay, I am content.*

**When did Conan the Barbarian decide to come out?**
