Well well it turns out that when John Boehner isn’t [crying like a
little
girl](http://www.buzzfeed.com/akdobbins/john-boehner-crying-a-comprehensive-guide)
he can deliver a speech. Tonight he smoked Obama like a fine cigar. I
tried to flip around Obama’s debt limit rant but ended up watching like
a gawker at a hospital fire.

Any dolt with a fifth graders grasp of arithmetic can see [the US is
completely and irrevocably broke!](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) We’re in
such a deep dark debt hole that we haven’t seen sunlight for eons.
Financial rickets is setting in; the soft bones of the republic will
soon need Viagra.

But don’t worry our elected pets have a plan! They’re going to borrow
and print more money so we can wire up our deep dark dept hole with
overpriced union-made lamps connected to a green, made in China, energy
source. If the government’s math is right the lights should stay on long
enough so we can all find our assholes and shove our heads up
them!
