Have you ever noticed that the “origin stories” of religious figures and
comic superheroes have a lot in common? Green Lantern is given a
powerful ring. Moses is handed magic tablets. Buddha, a wealthy
patrician, is horrified by injustice and suffering and decides to fix
things: ditto for Batman. A powerful, otherworldly being, comes to Earth
to save us. Are we talking about Christ or Superman? The only difference
between comic book heroes and religious figures is: comic book origin
stories are more plausible. There is a teeny tiny chance that being
bitten by a radioactive spider will give you some powers, probably a
tolerance for certain arachnid proteins, but there is absolutely no
chance that long dead John the Baptist will poof back from the dead to
baptize your semi-literate backwoods ass.
