Eons ago, upon learning that Barak Obama, aka the [Magic
Lightbringer](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-campaign-spot/magic-lightbringer-messiah-not-new-terms-obama-jim-geraghty/),
had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for [doing sweet
diddly-squat](https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2009/10/09/nobel-peace-prize-idol/),
I rightfully concluded that the Nobel Peace Prize had completed its long
embarrassing journey to absolute irrelevance. I opined that frivolous
[Canadian Idol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Idol) awards
meant more because at least Idol recipients had to "do stuff."

Well, I'm happy to report that the Oscars have also completed their long
sanctimonious, holier-than-thou, pilgrimage to pure pointlessness. With
today's woke-minded announcement that films must be "sufficiently
diverse" to qualify for a Best Picture Oscar, the Oscars are no longer
even pretending to be about quality. Frankly, it would be more honest to
simply "cancel" the Best Picture Oscar and replace it with a "Wokist
Picture Oscar."

I know I should just ignore this shit, but it's hard to resist looking
down the outhouse toilet hole. To qualify for the Wokist Picture Oscar
[a film must meet some
basic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/movies/oscars-best-picture-diversity.html)
(Standard A)[^6975x1] criteria:

1.  At least one actor from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group
    must be cast in a significant role.

2.  The story must center on women, L.G.T.B.Q. people, a racial or
    ethnic group or the disabled.

3.  At least 30 percent of the cast must be actors from at least two of
    those four underrepresented categories.

Strictly applied, *Hollyweirdo's* new diversity rules would eliminate
*Hamlet.* Hamlet has no *overtly-out* gay characters[^6975x2], no preening
lesbians, no bitchy bull dykes, no flouncing pussy boys. And, even
worse, Hamlet, in all its iambic pentameter'ized glory, is about *pale
white Danes.* Where's the diversity?

The *Hollyidiots* have really [jumped the
shark](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jump-the-shark)
here. The creation of art is hard enough without moronic
*HR-Grant-Application-Legalistic-AA*[^6975x3] bullshit piled on!

[^6975x1]: Yes, there are more "standards." It's not enough to wreak the
    Oscars with art killing mandates; the entire process must have the
    exquisite eyeball rolling tedium of a corporate HR policy.

[^6975x2]: We've all had our suspicions about Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

[^6975x3]: *Asinine Action*
