Many think we are living in a golden age of bullshit. That public
discourse has never been gaudier or more demeaning. That respect for
truth and decency has reached all-time lows. The mental pygmies that
hold these opinions don’t read or think for themselves. Deceiving
ourselves and others is the one thing our species excels at. Lies are
the bedrock of art, economics, politics, and religion. Only two tiny
slivers of human thought have ever breached the bullshit barrier and
approached something that might be credibly labeled truth: hard science,
and harder mathematics.

If you think I am going to praise brave men, (and bitches), of science
for lighting a candle in the perpetual darkness, (Carl Sagan already
wrote [an entire fawning
book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World)
on this self-aggrandizing theme), think again. Scientists are just as
flawed and full of crap as the rest of us. Science occasionally succeeds
because it has evolved protocols that correct for human bullshit. A good
protocol protects us against our worst enemy — ourselves.

My *Informed Naked Ape Protocol*, or *iNap* for short, consists of
eleven[^1x5582] pithy maxims that force a [hard ass
skeptical](https://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2009/10/29/hard-ass-skeptic-rules/)
view of things. I will manifest my maxims here and elaborate on each one
in following posts.

*Informed Naked Ape Protocol*

1.  Enough people are scum.

2.  Trust is for imbeciles.

3.  “Belief” is a bullshit word.

4.  Assume corruption.

5.  Analyze the data, not the drivel.

6.  Demand full analytic disclosure.

7.  Practice relentless verification.

8.  Centralized systems are always corrupted.

9.  If you don’t control it you cannot trust it.

10. Only scientific and mathematical arguments are admissible.

11. Correct errors.

[^1x5582]: Why eleven? The last time somebody tried to get the inhabitants of
    planet moron to follow ten simple rules it didn’t work out.
