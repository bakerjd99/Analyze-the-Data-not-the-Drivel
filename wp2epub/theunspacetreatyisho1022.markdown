2011 marks the [42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8)’nd
anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. 42 [idiot
infested](https://www.newser.com/story/comments/64908/moon-landing-denier-exposed-as-a-cheat.html)
years have passed since that glorious day and nothing that has happened
since comes within a nautical league of matching it. My vile boomer
generation has downplayed the significance of space exploration for
decades. I remember getting a shrill lecture from my left leaning fifth
grade teacher about what a waste of money the space program was. Being a
self-assured child so I told my teacher he was preening unimaginative
Neanderthal. This landed me in detention but I refused to apologize.

Manned space flight has been in a depressing, decades long, holding
pattern. The real advances in space exploration have come exclusively
from unmanned probes and robots. While astronauts have been going round
and round in that orbiting boondoggle known as the International Space
Station the [Voyagers](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/) are on the brink of
interstellar space, probes are on their way to
[Pluto](https://pluto.jhuapl.edu/) and
[Mercury](https://messenger.jhuapl.edu/),
[Cassini](https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/) is orbiting Saturn, a small
armada of
[orbiters](https://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars\_Express/index.html) and
[crawlers](https://marsrover.nasa.gov/home/) are exploring Mars,
low-budget missions discovered [water on the
moon](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303339504575566194097878552.html),
space telescopes like [Chandra](https://chandra.harvard.edu/),
[Hubble](https://hubblesite.org/hubble\_20/) and
[Spitzer](https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/) have shown us wonder after
wonder and, capping it all off, [WMAP](https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
determined the age of the entire frigging universe. Compare these
awesome achievements to ISS astronauts [unplugging zero-G
toilets](https://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=26\&num=20926).

Why has so little been accomplished? I can think of two good reasons.

1.  Exclusive government control

2.  The UN Space Treaty

Until recently only governments could afford space programs. In the
early days of space exploration government control made sense but that
era is [coming to an end](https://www.spacex.com/). In a few decades
private entities will be able to mount manned Mars expeditions and send
robots anywhere in the solar system and beyond. The technology is coming
along nicely but I am afraid the politics will soon be a gigantic
millstone around our necks. The millstone takes the form of the [absurd
UN Space
Treaty](https://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html).

The UN space treaty is another sorry artifact of the 1960’s. It reads
like a bunch of unwashed socialist hippies got together and decided to
ban capitalism in space. There is no other way to explain ridiculous
terms like:

1.  *The exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the
    benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the
    province of all mankind*.

2.  *Outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of
    sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.*

3.  *States shall be responsible for national space activities whether
    carried out by governmental or non-governmental activities.*

4.  *States shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects.*

5.  *States shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial
    bodies.*

Suppose some daring entrepreneur decides to mount an asteroid mining
expedition. This is not as crazy as it sounds. Asteroids are relatively
easy to get to and very easy to get off of. They also contain [mountains
of valuable rare earths, platinum and
gold.](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/401227.stm) Eros alone holds
well over [20 trillion
dollars](https://www.suite101.com/content/economic-impact-of-asteroids-space-exploration-a187015)
of metals. You could pay off the US national debt by mining one dinky
asteroid! One day, not very long from now, robot asteroid mining will
make a compelling business case. To bad the UN Space Treaty outlaws it.

If you have to pay off all of mankind (\#1, \#2) your compelling
business case evaporates. Environmentalists, (yeah space
environmentalists), would complain that mining damages and contaminates
a celestial body (\#4, \#5). Finally, even if the operation was 100%
privately funded, various governments could legally ransom our daring
entrepreneur or shut him down (\#3). These tactics have already been
tried. Remember the [hysteria that preceded the launch of
Cassini](https://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/01/local/me-37979). A pack
of morons decided that the [Plutonium powered
RTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope\_thermoelectric\_generator)
on Cassini posed a grave threat to all mankind and started citing [the
UN Space Treaty in hopes of blocking the
launch](https://www.animatedsoftware.com/cassini/trea9704.htm). Cassini
was not a money-making operation so we ignored the loons. Asteroid
mining will be another thing all together. Everyone will want their cut.
With the UN in charge we’re going to feel like the *probed* subjects in
this Kids in Hall video.
