If genocide is sudden, painless, unexpected, complete and absolute, if a
people simply vanish without screams, without fear, without
*anticipation*, if one nanosecond they are and the next nanosecond they
*are not*, and if somehow you are responsible, are you a war criminal or
a savior? Ultimately we all vanish, usually with screams, usually with
fear, usually with anticipation. For years I’ve longed for a sudden
painless death: a *dismembering* that tears me apart faster than my
nerves can relay pain. Imagine such an end for all of us – at once –
now. *Why linger?* We will go extinct. There will be a last human. And
if the last human dies with screams, with fear, with anticipation how is
that better than sudden genocide?
