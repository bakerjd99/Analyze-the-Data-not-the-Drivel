Remember [Mr. Peabody’s Wayback
Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkqn7O1lHFI). Mr Peabody was
dog, with a pet boy Sherman, that used his Wayback time travel machine
to visit the past. I’m not sure if he ever visited the future; that’s a
question best left to [Rocky and Bullwinkle
historians](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2009/12/22/berkeley-history-rocky-and-bullwinkle/).
Well, I have Wayback machines; they’re called film and flatbed scanners.
I spend way to much time scanning and restoring old photographs. Over
the years I’ve scanned thousands of images. It only takes a few minutes
to get a high quality scan but it can take days of image editing to
restore old damaged originals. Hence, I always have a backlog of scanned
pictures to fix.

My enthusiasm for this endless task waxes and wanes with my general
photographic energies. A few weeks ago I upgraded my arsenal of DLSR
cameras and lenses. New lenses always give me boast. So lately I’ve been
out pixel harvesting with a lovely little $f$2.8 macro lens. I think she
I will be an item for years to come — wide open her bokeh is beautiful.
While I enjoy working with my spanking new crystal clear digital images
I often find myself wandering in my vast image file directories and picking
out old scans to work on. Today I whiled away a rainy afternoon
restoring pictures I took over forty years ago. Here’s a shot from my
[ACS Beirut

boarding school days. This is from an old
[Instamatic](https://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Instamatic) camera. I
believe it was my second camera. Over the years my cameras have gotten
better and better but they still cannot go Wayback in time.
