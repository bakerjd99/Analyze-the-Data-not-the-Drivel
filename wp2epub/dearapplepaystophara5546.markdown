Pay Stop Harassing Me!](http://analyzethedatanotthedrivel.org/2017/12/26/dear-apple-pay-stop-harassing-me/)

Dear Apple Pay stop harassing me! I will never sign up for you and no
amount of iOS app-nagging will change that. You’re pathetic
interruptions merely remind me why I “resist” installing every freaking
iOS upgrade the Apple mothership foists on its hapless phone users.

I use an iPhone[^1]but I am not a member of the bleating iSheep. I’ve
slowly, one unwanted upgrade after another, developed an intense
loathing of Apple’s holier than thou, we know what’s best for the
iIdiots, attitude. You’re beginning to remind me of the Hildabeast.
Remember that foul creature and her well-deserved fate!

Loathing aside, I have a perfectly logical reason for refusing Apple
Pay. Unlike the bleating iSheep, I see what you are trying to do. You
want to become a financial “middleman.” You want to skim an
ever-increasing percentage of every transaction your well-trained herd
of iSheep makes. I admire your larcenous spirit but if you haven’t
noticed, we have enough parasitic financial rent-seeking middlemen on
this insane planet. Part of the allure and promise of cryptocurrencies
is that they show a way to rid the universe of skimming scum like
central banks, government fiat, rapacious money transmitters, exchange
controls and abominations like Apple Pay.

Don’t ever darken my day with another “activate Apple Pay now” message
again. You have been warned!

[^1]: Unless there are big changes at Apple this is my last iPhone. I
    want a device that I absolutely control. “If you don’t control it
    you cannot trust it.” Any phone that I cannot even be sure is off
    does not qualify. Burners may be my only option.
