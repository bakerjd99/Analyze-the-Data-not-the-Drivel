There are two types of stories about major astronomical observatories.
There are stories about new discoveries and observation technologies and
then there are stories about how batshit crazy people are! Lately a
[rash of batshit
crazy](http://www.popsci.com/contentious-mauna-kea-telescope-website-downed-cyberattack)
has broken out over the construction of the [Thirty Meter
Telescope](http://www.tmt.org/) on Mauna Kea. The ignorant press is
casting the story as another tale of wanton destruction of sacred
pristine aboriginal environments by “big astronomy.” On most days I
ignore the moron maelstrom but I’m in bad mood today. I couldn’t resist
venting on [The
Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/27/environmental_protestors_hack_hawaiian_telescope_site/).
The following is a slightly edited version of my *contribution to the
conversation* bitches!

*Trigger Warning: searing contempt for tools and fools!*

> What’s happening on Mauna Kea happened before on Mount Graham in

> [Large Binocular Telescope](http://www.lbto.org/) because it might
> stress some squirrels. Well the scope got built and the [squirrels are

> will continue to thrive because their habitat will not be sodomized by
> condo developers and other invasive lower life forms.

> class” aboriginal brown people sky fairies, are complete and utter
> rubbish! Jesus did not rise from the dead, Mohammed did not ascend to
> heaven, and Pele is not stomping around on Mauna Kea regardless of
> what native Hawaiians believe. If this offends you demonstrate why
> your sky fairy is any less imaginary than [The Flying Spaghetti
> Monster](http://www.venganza.org/). “Belief” is a bullshit word. It
