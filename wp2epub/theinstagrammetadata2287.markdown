I’ve been playing around with the iPhone app
[Instagram](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8).
I decided to give this freebie a try after a gaggle of soulless self
promoting Apple marketing zombies declared it “imaging [app of the
year](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-12-08/tech/30489467\_1\_android-apps-ipad).”
Instagram, like [Hipstamatic](http://hipstamatic.com/the\_app.html),
(which incidentally stopped working after the last update), crops iPhone
images to squares, applies hokey filters and then offers you the
opportunity to “share” or print your masterpieces on related websites.
Apparently Instagram is already one of the words largest online photo
libraries. Considering Instagram images are filtered iPhone shots it’s
almost certainly *the world's second largest online collection of crappy
throw-away shots. Facebook is the largest if you’re wondering!*

You probably sense that I am not drinking the Instagram cool-aid.
Instagram is a fine fun freebie but it strips EXIF data from the images
it drops in the iPhone camera roll. This is the second [iPhone EXIF
exterminator](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/smugshot-metadata-mess/)
I have encountered. I have this thing about EXIF data; it annoys me when
software massacres it. Here’s a little poem:

----------------------------
*Exterminate EXIF - **NOT***\
*Let it be*\
*Set your fricking EXIF free*\
***Alas, with Instagram, it’s not to be!***
