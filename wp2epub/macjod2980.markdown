The [J addon](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons) JOD now runs on
Macs. You can update
[JOD](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/jod), or install it
for the first time, with [JAL](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/JAL). JOD
now runs on all the major J hosts: Windows, Linux and the Mac.

To keep track of host specific features I have started a series of
version documents. The Mac document is
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-PUUB-a9UTY9gC-H26Fe8sEfQryGt5cOWRJVYBtVAw/edit?pli=1).

At the upcoming [J
conference](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Community/Conference2012),
(July 23-24, 2012), in Toronto I will show an iPhone version of JOD.
And, as a reward for attending the conference and my little
presentation, *Writing Portable J addons*, I will be raffling off
hardcopy [printed
versions](http://www.lulu.com/shop/john-baker/jod-j-object-dictionary/paperback/product-20076245.html)
of the JOD manual.

An updated PDF version of the JOD manual is available
[here](https://www.box.com/shared/gajfu50gc0). For more see [The JOD
Page](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/).
