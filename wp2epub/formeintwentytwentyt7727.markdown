Let's get this over with!

Every year I task myself with a list of *publicly declared goals,*[^7727x1]
and then in the next year, if I find myself among the living,[^7727x2] I
grade myself. How did 2022 go? Let's start with my *small* goals.

1.  **Goal:** *Observe as many Messier objects as weather permits and
    get my [RASC](https://rasc.ca/) certificate.*

Well, I did not get my RASC certificate but I made progress. Meridian's
skies are often overcast and even when clear, are horribly
light-polluted. I figure I can only *naked-eye* magnitude 3 or 4 stars
from my backyard. When using my binoculars or telescope I estimate I
lose two or more stellar magnitudes to light pollution. Bright,
magnitude 8 or 9 Messier objects, that are easily seen with binoculars
from dark sites are not visible in my backyard. It's frustrating. [*Urge
to kill rising!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdO--3UL5D8) To make a
dent in my list of *missing Messiers* I will need to seek out dark
skies. For 2023, I am repeating this goal; I will keep looking until I
complete my *Messiers* or expire. As for my "grade," I'm giving myself
an **Incomplete**.

1.  **Goal:** *Learn more proper northern hemisphere star names.*

I am pursuing the quixotic quest of stepping outside on my patio and
calling out the visible "named" stars. This is a rare astronomical task
that *light pollution helps*; it greatly reduces the number of stars you
must name. I am making slow progress. I can already achieve this goal on
some nights, especially partly overcast nights, as only the brightest
planets and stars can be seen. For 2023 I will increase my efforts and
cultivate some productive habits like looking up the ten brightest named
stars visible from my backyard on given nights. I'm giving myself
another **Incomplete**.

1.  **Goal:** *Continue shooting and adding captioned images to [my
    pictures site](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/).*

In 2022 I set an all-time captioned image upload record. I wrote almost
as many *caption words*[^7727x3] (about 50 pages), as *blog words* (about 60
pages). Many 2022 pictures came from our [Australia and New Zealand
trip](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/Trips/Overseas/Australia-New-Zealand-2022/i-FdKCt59).
But, importantly, I more than met my goal. I'm giving myself an **A+**.
For 2023 I am not setting an image quota. I will upload pictures when
the whim strikes.

1.  **Goal:** *Read at least ten books.*

I read twenty books so I'm giving myself an **A**. For 2023 I am not
setting any reading goals. I will read what I read.

1.  **Goal:** *Blog more!*

In 2022 I cranked out 19 blog posts: not great, but better than many
previous years. I'm giving myself a **C+**. For 2023 I am planning to
break my all-time blog post record. In 2012 I wrote 37 posts, so I have
to hit 38.

That completes my small goals for 2022. In 2023 I'm adding one
additional small goal.

1.  **Goal:** *Weigh 85 kilograms or less on December 25, 2024.*

For the last two years, I have been slowly losing weight: currently, I'm
at 88 kilograms. I haven't been making an effort to lose weight, it's a
consequence of walking a lot, and staying on the Mali diet. The Mali
diet is super-heathy, anyone that stays on it will lose weight. I might
as well make it a little goal.

Now let's address the *Humpback in the Sea*. How did I do with my
primary priority project which was:

1.  **Whale Goal:** *Write a first draft of a short book that uses
    [LEAN](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) to formally prove
    some school geometry theorems.*

I've written a fragmented partial draft and I've made headway on the
thousands of little things you must do to write a book about software,
mathematics, and history but overall, I have failed --- abjectly! I'm
giving myself an **F+***. I am not giving up!* I will continue working
on this project in 2023 but I'm changing how I swim after this whale.

To start, I am going to write some *typical programs* in
[LEAN4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4). The LEAN type system is
powerful enough to *formally* prove advanced mathematical theorems. This
distinguishes LEAN from most programming languages and tells this old
polyglot programmer that "LEANish" languages represent something new and
important. Most mathematicians using LEAN focus on formal theorem
proving but my tiny naked ape brain may have better luck with prosaic
"hello world" applications. As I work out some LEAN programs I will post
them here.

Finally, I'm going to take Roy Peter Clark's advice (see [Writing
Tools](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Tools-Essential-Strategies-Writer-ebook/dp/B000SEIW9E))
and write about the problems I face while working on my draft. I'll use
this blog as a test site, sounding board, whipping post, and
confessional as I foolishly attempt to outswim a whale.

Overall, I'm rating 2022 as a **D+** year. I will make efforts to
improve, and if in 2024 I find myself among the living, I will tell you
about it.

[^7727x1]: Private goals can be conveniently memory-holed.

[^7727x2]: At my age this cannot be taken granted.

[^7727x3]: I call them
