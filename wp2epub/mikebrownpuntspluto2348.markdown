As a longtime amateur astronomer I appreciate good science writing and
Mike Brown’s little book [How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It
Coming](https://www.amazon.com/How-Killed-Pluto-Why-Coming/dp/0385531087)
is a wonderful example of the genre. When Pluto was tossed from the
pantheon of planets I didn’t care. I knew that in previous centuries,
when asteroids were first discovered, that they were briefly counted as
planets. Eventually asteroids lost their planet status; there were too
many of them and they were all dinky compared to real planets. Brown
notes this bit of astronomical history by pointing to 19th century
textbooks with high planet counts. The same holds for Pluto,
[Eris](https://www.astronomytoday.com/astronomy/eris.html),
[Sedna,](https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/planet\_like\_body.html)
[Quaoar](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1003\_021007\_quaoar.html)
and all the other known baby ice balls that make up the [Kuiper
belt](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=KBOs\&Display=OverviewLong).
Real planets are massive enough to clear their orbits of crap. By this
standard Mars barely qualifies and Pluto does not.

The [emotional hysterics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNaNxo9jFHE)
that greeted Pluto’s demise are still playing out. [Some reviews posted
here castigate Brown](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/257414013) in
terms rightly applied to suicide bombers and Obama voters. When Pluto
bulks up and starts bullying its neighbors like all manly planets do
we’ll talk until then I’d advise the puerile Pluto partisans to plumb up
their pie holes otherwise we’ll have to toss you in the crank bin with
the creationists and cold fusion nitwits.
