The kids at [GitHub](https://github.com/) have tested positive for Mad
Woke Disease (MWD) - *again!*

The last outbreak was over [codes of
conduct](https://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2018/10/22/sqlite_code_of_conduct/)
this time it's about naming Git repository *master branches!* If you're
wondering what's a Git *master branch* and why infantile *wokesters* are
acting out I envy you. Perhaps you should stop reading now. MWD is a
pathetic mental illness. It robs sufferers of perspective and judgement
and often induces inane bouts of vacuous virtue signaling.

Still here - you were warned - let's dig into the tiresome
technicalities.

GitHub is a major website that hosts tens of thousands of [Git code
repositories](https://git-scm.com/). Code repositories are specialized
databases that track *program component* changes. The most commonly
tracked components are source code files but other binary components
like image files are also tracked. Code repositories make it possible
for widely dispersed programmers to collaborate on large projects
without *irreversibly* wreaking each other's work. Hence, GitHub and
it's [competitors](https://bitbucket.org/), matter to software
developers.

So what's this master branch?

Program code evolves like living organisms and just like relationships
between organisms are shown on "tree of life" diagrams program
relationships are displayed on repository branch diagrams. Complex
programs have pedigrees that look like *inbred* royal family trees.

If you look closely at the left side of the next diagram you'll notice
that the line of green dots beside the inbreeding graphic is labeled
**"master"**.

I know what you're thinking. How did white supremacists infiltrate the
woke thinking denizens of GitHub and embed racially loaded terms like
"master" in code repositories? Obviously, wherever the word "master"
occurs it's referring to slavery and the brutal suppression of people of
color[^1x5835] because *words have only one meaning and context is always
irrelevant*. To atone for their terminological sins GitHub is planning
to rename the "master" branch something *currently* innocuous like
"main".

With all the shit plugging global toilets why did GitHub's plumbers
choose this silly turd to flush?

The use of the word "master" is a longstanding Git convention. Unlike
other branches the master branch cannot be renamed. This is a minor
annoyance and I support efforts to *allow* other words but having a
fixed name for the master branch has advantages. It simplifies automatic
program builds as they don't have to determine what the master branch is
called today. If the master branch is forcibly renamed it will break
thousands of builds all over the world. Think of it as a digital black
lives matter riot.

Here are a few rhetorical questions:

- If the "master" branch is renamed "main" will it fix racism?

- Will renaming the master branch demonstrably improve a single black life?

- What will we call Chess Grandmasters[^2x5835]?

- Must we rename Masters Degrees to Main Degrees?

- What about the Master's Golf Tournament?

- Or masterclasses?

And, it goes without saying, that we can never *master* anything, *in
the sense of high achievement*, ever again because because it's clearly
*woke racist*[^3x5835].

[^1x5835]: "People of color" is woke but the transposition "colored people"
    is not! The improper use of word order or pronouns is now a capital
    offense. First time offenders will be let off with a Twitter beating
    but if you persist, like some nagging *people of vagina*, it's
    straight to the burning pyre for you.

[^2x5835]: Contrary to widespread woke opinion "Grandmaster" is not a [KKK
    rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Wizard)

[^3x5835]: *Woke racism* should not be confused with real racism.
