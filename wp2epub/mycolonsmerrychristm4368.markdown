I have just returned from my second colonoscopy. For all you
indestructible young’ins out there a colonoscopy is a medical procedure
that basically entails stuffing a camera up your butthole to look for
evil-doers. Thankfully you’re knocked out during the procedure and when
you come to you remember about as much as [alien anal probe
abductees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player\_embedded\&v=KBhru5nLpGE).
Colonoscopies can detect and remove precancerous polyps in the colon;
it’s a rare cost-effective procedure that actually saves lives. If
you’re an old fart that hasn’t been probed I would suggest you ask your
doctor about colonoscopies.

My colonoscopy went well. No polyps were found so I don’t have to do
this again for ten years. The best thing about colonoscopies: the
pictures. If you’re into colon porn prepare to feast your eyes otherwise
avert them because you will never be able to *unsee* what follows. The
notes on my report noted the “good colon preparation” which, in the
immortal words of John Harvey Kellogg played by Anthony Hopkins in the
definitive crazy health nut mocking movie [The Road to
Wellville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLUPJR6wz-I), means 
[“my colon is clean.”](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/my-colons-merry-christmas/colonoscopy2013b/)
