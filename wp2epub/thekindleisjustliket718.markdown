Oh Mohammed in a brothel how much more of this idiocy can we endure? A
certain brain-damaged official, ([Thomas
Perez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas\_Perez)), in the US
Department of Justice apparently thinks allowing Universities to
experiment with [delivering textbooks via the Kindle violates the civil
rights of the
blind.](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/Why-did-feds-claim-Kindle-violates-civil-rights\_-1006723-99801389.html)
This so is mind-boggling stupid that I thought it was a bad joke. Well
it is a joke and itâ€™s on us! We are entering the final stages of
[Pournellian Iron Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry\_Pournelle)
paralysis in the United States. Remember a vote for any Democrat
anywhere is a vote for submission to morons like Perez.
