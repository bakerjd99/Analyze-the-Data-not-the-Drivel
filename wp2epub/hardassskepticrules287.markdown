I am a hard ass skeptic. A hard ass skeptic is somebody that holds:

1.  Ghosts do not exist

2.  Gods do not exist

3.  UFOs are not alien spaceships

4.  There are no Yetis

5.  There are no psychics

6.  9/11 was not an inside job

7.  Life after death is nonsense

8.  Reincarnation is more nonsense

9.  Somebody called Christ did not rise from the grave

10. Mohammed did not ascend to heaven

11. The world will not end in 2012

12. Heaven and Hell do not exist

13. You cannot build a Good and Evil meter

Hard ass skeptics are often accused of being sour, bitter, judgmental
*know-it-alls* by the usual crew of credulous buffoons. Cry me a river
people! No matter how many idiotic ghost hunting shows you put on the
history channel you are never going to convince a hard ass skeptic that
ghosts exist. Just so we can all get along I am going to disclose how
you can win an argument with a hard ass skeptic.

The key to marketing ideas to hard ass skeptics is to understand what
hard ass skeptics consider valid arguments. Hard ass skeptics will
consider only two types of arguments:

1.  Mathematical proof

2.  Hard science

If you cannot couch your argument in these terms just shut the fuck up.
You are wasting your breath and the hard ass skeptic’s time.

I know this is harsh but it gets worse. Mathematicians and scientists
make mistakes: lots and lots of mistakes. How does the hard ass skeptic
deal with this *inconvenient* truth? The typical hard ass skeptic simply
doesn’t have enough time, skill or expertise to filter the rubbish from
the rubies. ***So the hard ass skeptic assumes it’s all crap until there
is verified overwhelming evidence to the contrary.***

Finally, hard ass skeptics *put the burden of proof on a supposition’s
supporters.* It’s not the hard ass skeptic’s job to prove you are wrong.
It’s your job to prove, beyond any reasonable mathematical or scientific
doubt, you are correct. So please stop whining about how we haven’t
proved that psychics, Yetis or Heaven do not exist. It’s not our job and
it never will be.
