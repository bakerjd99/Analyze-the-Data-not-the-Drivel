I've been refreshing my blog's look. I created new favicons,
blog-banners, and changed my WordPress theme to a simpler and more
modern style. I'd really like to harmonize my
[picture](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/) and blog sites, but CSS
issues are frustrating me. I have no desire to plunge into the CSS blog
sand, but if you care about online appearances it's hard to avoid.

The last time I changed my WordPress theme, I spent hours editing old
posts in an unsatisfactory effort to make them conform to the new theme.
Theoretically, you shouldn't have to do this. The whole point of a
*theme* is to consolidate your visual style points into one easily
altered file. But, like many "theories", *the one theme to rule them all
theory*, often fails when it comes up against complex blog posts that
harbor text-wrapped images, wonky tables, program code, LaTeX fragments,
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) extracts, and custom HTML hacks.

Yeah, my blog is a mess!

I vowed I wouldn't edit old posts this time around. When you step in the
blog sand it's hard to get out, but I'm weak, lack restraint, and suffer
from a touch of *perfectionism*. Still, in my defense, how could I live
with text surrounded by `ugly nontransparent` backgrounds? So, once
again, I jumped into the blog sand and thrashed about[^6613x1] trying to make
the ugly go away.

*The ugly will always be with us!*

If there is one take-away from my struggle it is this:

**Keep things simple stupid!**

Complex typography is best practiced on paper/PDF. When composing blog
posts always choose the simplest style that works. If you eschew
flourishes the next time you change your theme, *and there will be a
next time*, you won't sink as deeply into the blog sand.

[^6613x1]: Blog sand is like quicksand in that the more you struggle the
    deeper you sink.
