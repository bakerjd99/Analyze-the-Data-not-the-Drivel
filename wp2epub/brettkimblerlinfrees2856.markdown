Today I’m joining a [free speech
blogburst](http://michellemalkin.com/2012/05/23/free-speech-show-solidarity-for-targeted-conservative-bloggers/)
in support of [bloggers harassed and
threatened](http://patterico.com/2012/05/25/convicted-bomber-brett-kimberlin-neal-rauhauser-ron-brynaert-and-their-campaign-of-political-terrorism/)
by Brett Kimberlin
([SOS](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sack%20of%20shit))
and his butt monkeys. Brett has a problem with people pointing out his
bomb detonating [criminal
terrorist](http://pjmedia.com/blog/brett-kimberlin-and-the-future-of-blogbursts/)
past but, unlike your typical effeminate impotent lefty whiner, Brett
isn’t going to take any truth-telling lying down. No Brett is going to
wage scorched earth [lawfare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare) and
if that isn’t good enough get some of his unhinged goons to threaten
violence. Yes, Brett practices the restrained dispassionate discourse
advocated by [The One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopkn0lPzM8).
Unfortunately Brett has pissed off some real men and women and those of
us with gnarly gonads and fertile ovaries will not be intimidated by our
intellectual, moral and cosmetic inferiors. So sue me if you want Brett.
Threaten me if you have the balls but before you get in my face keep in
mind that Missouri is a concealed carry state.
