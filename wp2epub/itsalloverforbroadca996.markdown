Human beings are worthless [lumps of lazy
protoplasm](https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/love-sex/why-do-successful-women-settle-for-lazy-lumps-1587083.html).
We only change our bad habits when that bitch — *reality* — forces us to
reconsider our wayward ways. In this respect the [great
recession](https://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/It-Will-Take-Years-for-Your-Paycheck-to-Recover-From-the-Great-Recession-6523)
has been a wonderful teacher. It’s sat us down and made us stare at the
books. And arithmetic, being what it is, has brought out the savage
budget slasher in all of us.

The amount of money we were handing over to the cable company for the
privilege of watching crap on TV could not be justified. We cut it off —
no cable, no satellite, no HD, nada zip zilch! When annualized that’s
$500 bucks. What the hell were we thinking? $500 dollars wasted on TV.
Thank you recession.

[OMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMG\_They\_Killed\_Kenny) no live TV
- how do you survive? Being old farts we starting reading more but then
one day, in the midst of acute [Family
Guy](https://www.hulu.com/family-guy) withdrawal, we tried streaming. It
had been years since I last tried watching video on computers. Five
years ago streaming video was more like [steaming
pile](https://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=episode3) of
video. I didn’t expect things had improved but I was wrong. On
high-speed internet connections streaming is now *good enough* to
replace TV. For months we’ve been enjoying free streaming sites like
[Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/). I really enjoy some old, rarely seen,
classic TV programs. Check out this [episode of Alfred Hitchcock
Presents](https://www.hulu.com/embed/sp1x3wBXdMfrNzCrDGiIYg). It’s a neat
story with a probability lesson and a [hard ass
skeptic](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/hard-ass-skeptic-rules/)
ending.
