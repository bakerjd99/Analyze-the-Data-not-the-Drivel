I see Obama’s [awesome
intellect](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKx1C0gY6Qk) has been working
overtime. I guess this is plan B after plan A was scuttled by a [raging
homophobe.](http://metroweekly.com/news/?ak=5208) Forgive my “hickness”
but if a homophobe could actually [plug the damn
hole](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/99713-obama-to-aides-plug-the-damn-hole?page=46)
I would gladly overlook some queer queasiness.
