*Analyze the Data not the Drivel* is a mouthful. This blog needs a short
symbolic name. For sometime I have used ADND myself but that’s to close
to
[ADHD](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml)
for comfort. However if we treat ADND as a simple algebraic expression
it becomes:

$$ad^2n$$

This is better but still not cool! If we replace Latin characters with
colored Farsi equivalents and reverse the order we get:

[New symbolic blog name](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2013/12/29/fun-with-farsi-text-in-latex/adndsymbol/)

To generate this with LaTeX you need a version that handles UTF-8
Unicode. I used LuaLaTeX.  You also need an OTF or TTF font with Farsi
or Arabic characters. The following LaTeX [snippet generates my
logo](https://github.com/bakerjd99/Analyze-the-Data-not-the-Drivel/tree/master/logos).
