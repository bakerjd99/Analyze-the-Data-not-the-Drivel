My superpower is indifference. Indifference is the soporific that lets
my inner beast nap in peace. Without it I would have long since turned
into a murdering psychopath, but I remain calm, rational, nearly
ethereal, as I proudly ignore the unhinged idiocy of my fellow human
beings. I prize my detachment, my don’t-give-a-shit-ness, my lordly
disdain, and I work hard to maintain it. Today I’m sharing one of my,
how to resist pummeling the morons around you, secrets. Here it is:
*don’t read rubbish.*

Now, don’t fire up your [book
Barbie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETJP1ElHTps); that’s not what
I’m suggesting. I’m asking you to upgrade your standards and scoot past
toxic aisles in your favorite book store. Ignorable books are legion and
they’re relatively easy to identify. The following rules have served me
well.

1.  **Do not read biographies of living people.** There are few, if any,
    definitive biographies of the living for the simple reason that
    they’re almost impossible to write without triggering crippling law
    suits. Historical figures, and their entire sycophantic
    bottom-feeding cohort, must be long dead before anything approaching
    perspective is possible. So put down that [Prince of
    Wales](https://www.amazon.com/Prince-Wales-Biography-Jonathan-Dimbleby/dp/0688146155)
    or, don’t make me puke, [Ted
    Turner](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ted-turner-michael-oconnor/1103045877?cm\_mmc=googlepla-\_-book-\_-q000000633-\_-9780313350429\&cm\_mmca2=pla\&ean=9780313350429\&isbn=9780313350429\&r=1),
    biography. They’re trash, worse than pornography, at least porn
    facilitates release.

2.  **Do not read autobiographies.** Autobiographical fiction, and it
    always is, is akin to masturbating in public. Only one person is
    going to enjoy it. Everything I said about biographies goes double
    for autobiographies. We know you’re misleading, omitting,
    embellishing, polishing, fabricating, composting and just plain
    lying. If you’re one of the rare true worthies, say a [Fields
    Medalist](https://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/fields/details/),
    a hard science Nobel winner, a Caesar, or a Mark Twain then go ahead
    and indulge yourself. Your scribbling’s will show future generations
    that bullshit is the only human universal.

3.  **Do not read hyphenated anything.** Only mediocre twaddle preens as
    black-history, feminist-politics, gay-literature,
    Indian-mathematics, lesbian-drama or aboriginal-stories; the good
    stuff is known as history, politics, literature, mathematics, drama
    and stories.

4.  **Skip anything with “New Age” in its title, preamble, introduction,
    appendices or footnotes.** Virtually everything written about new
    age beliefs, medicine, philosophy and so on is complete and utter
    garbage. This dreck is for feeble, magical-thinking, childish minds.
    I genuinely pity the purveyors and swallowers of new-age bilge;
    they’re sad silly people: come the zombie apocalypse the Deepak
    Copra’s of the world are starters.

5.  **Eschew political diatribes written solely to exploit current
    events.** The political diatribe, or insta-history, like
    autobiographical fiction, may let readers in the future relive our
    self-deceptions, but we don’t live in the future. Most of these
    books emit a foul, *cash in on my 15 minutes of fame*, stench. I
    weep for the trees that died to print this crap.

6.  **Ignore books that rehash thoroughly debunked cover-ups and
    conspiracies.** 9/11 was not an inside job, there are no miracle
    cancer cures, Bigfoot does not exist, the pyramids were not built by
    aliens, dowsing is crap, Oswald shot Kennedy, and the world did not
    end on December 21, 2012. Being a [hard-ass
    skeptic](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/hard-ass-skeptic-rules/)
    clears entire drivel laden bookshelves.

7.  **Do not read diet books.** You are not going to learn anything you
    don’t already know. We know why we’re fat. We eat too much and move
    to little. It’s really that simple. Get off you’re stupid obese ass
    and stop wasting your money on diet books.

8.  **Do not read computer books with high screen-shot densities.** As a
    programmer I am constantly pawing through computer books and it
    pains me to report that vast swathes of this technical genre are
    awful. Stop printing one damn screen shot after another. It’s not
    helping.

9.  **Ignore how to get rich books.** Get rich whores are worse than
    insta-history whores and often far more damaging to the pocketbooks
    of gullible readers.

10. **Give any book sharing Steve Job’s secrets a wide berth.** The
    necrophages writing this tripe are stunted little animals. Let’s
    feed on the dead, rich, white guy. Maybe if we eat his soul we’ll
    get rich too.

See that wasn’t so bad. With these ten rules you, shrink big-box
bookstores to manageable dimensions, speed up online searching, and cut
your exposure to rage fomenting mental pollution. I must warn you that
there are exceptions my rules and it delights me when I find them. If
you can point to books that break my rules please drop a note. *I enjoy
being wrong; it’s an opportunity to learn something and it’s a rare
experience.*
