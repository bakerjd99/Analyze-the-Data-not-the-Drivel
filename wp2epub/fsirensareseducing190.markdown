For the last few days I have been playing around with an [early release
of
F\#](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/).
F\# looks like it might be a [.Net](http://www.microsoft.com/NET/)
language that I can stand! The alpha-geeks at Microsoft Research have
convinced their corporate masters that the world needs a *functional
programming language that can be compiled and executed as efficiently as
traditional imperative and object oriented languages.*

As a long time user of interpreted functional programming languages I
can only say: *it’s about freaking time!*

F\# appeals to me for a number of reasons:

1.  I am familiar with many of the concepts of functional programming.
    Coming from the
    [APL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL\_(programming\_language))
    world I have been using many of these ideas for decades.

2.  F\# can use .Net facilities. It can call, and be called, by any of
    the .Net languages. Lack of *deep supported* integration with host
    facilities has always hurt languages like J. You pretty much have to
    roll your own for everything.

3.  F\# can be compiled to virtual machine code just like C\#. APL, J, K
    and others do not compile well. [Heroic attempts have been made to
    compile APL](http://www.snakeisland.com/) and similar languages but
    sometimes heroes fail.

4.  F\# supports asynchronous and parallel programming. The typical
    computer these days has two, four, eight or more processors. In the
    very near future your grandmother’s PC will have eight or more 64
    bit processors and perhaps hundreds of gigabytes of *real*, (not
    virtual), memory. Programming such machines with conventional
    languages and tools will be, as one blogger noted, insanely
    complicated. F\# may provide a means to focus the power of such
    machines without sweating blood.

I have ordered [Programming
F\#](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596153656) and now I actually have
something to look forward to in [Visual Studio
2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010/default.mspx).
