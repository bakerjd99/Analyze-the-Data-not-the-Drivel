The best line in [*Eat Pray
Love*](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eat\_pray\_love/) comes early on.
When Liz Gilbert’s, (Julia Roberts), marriage is falling apart she gets
down on her knees and gives prayer a try. Now Liz, a successful author
and full-fledged member of the secular New York literati, realizes this
is a bit phony so she considers starting her prayer with, “Hello God,
I’m a big fan of your work.” I’m a big fan of Julia Robert’s work but
*Eat Pray Love* makes impossible chick flick demands.

The modern chick flick is a difficult genre. A good chick flick:

1.  Caters to women without alienating men.

2.  Treats *important but not serious* themes.

3.  Is funny in a harmless inoffensive way.

4.  Offers up current female fantasies of the ideal man.

5.  Pushes soft feminist politics.

6.  Goes easy on the [ball
    crushing](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ball%20crush)
    man hatred.

*Eat Pray Love* methodically tackles all these points; the film is
earnest to a fault! Yet two hours after seeing it you are left with
Julia Robert’s wonderful smile and a nagging sense that hubris laden
narcissists have picked your pockets — *again!* In this way *Eat Pray
Love* is the perfect Obama era chick flick. *Not recommended for people
with something better to do!*
