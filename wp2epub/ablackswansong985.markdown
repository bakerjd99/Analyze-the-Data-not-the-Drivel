There’s a lot to like in [The Black
Swan](http://www.foxsearchlight.com/blackswan/). To begin, you simply
cannot beat the soundtrack!
[Tchaikovsky](http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/tchaikovsky.php)
delivers a bit stream worthy of high quality digital cinema sound
systems. [Natalie Portman](http://www.natalieportman.com/) gives the
best performance of her career — now I see what the [young Darth
Vader](http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/anakinskywalker/) and
that [creepy V guy](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v\_for\_vendetta/)
saw in her! And, to cap it off, The Black Swan elegantly solves the
“ballet guy problem.” Real guys don’t do, watch, or appreciate ballet
but throw in some hot lesbian ballerina on ballerina action and suddenly
you’re up for a skinny dip in [Swan
Lake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bYTomI-Uiw) just to cool down.

I was expecting a
[euroweenie](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=euroweenie)
art film but the Swan exceeded my expectations by being — what’s that
word — *entertaining*. I particularly enjoyed being fooled until the last
scene. There is nothing I hate more than figuring out what’s going on in
a movie. I demand that lovely confused state of mind before all is
revealed. And for the denouement, I expect coherence and logic. I was
not disappointed. The Black Swan is a film ballet,

and psych patients can all enjoy for roughly the same reasons:
enthusiastically endorsed.
