Recently [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) introduced payment pages.
[Here’s my page](https://coinbase.com/bakerjd99). Payment pages simplify
the process of paying with Bitcoins. In the last six months more and
more businesses have started accepting Bitcoins. Once people
get cryptocurrencies they inevitably start questioning the legitimacy of
national currencies. This is all good. National currencies are part of
the past. It’s embarrassing to trade *debased presidents* or
*unnecessary queens* for goods.

I now pay online fees with Bitcoins when I can. I am doing this for
three reasons.

1.  **Bitcoin payments are orders of magnitude more secure than credit
    cards, PayPal or other online payment methods.** When you pay with
    Bitcoins you don’t spread personal information around. Bitcoin is a
    nightmare for identity thieves.

2.  **I want to encourage the widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a
    payment technology.** The entire parasitic financial class must be
    reformed or destroyed. A good way to kill something is to cut off
    its air supply. When you use credit cards a big cut
    goes to banks. Why enrich what you hate? Bitcoin, and its brethren,
    will help suffocate traditional banks and their despicable
    government cronies.

3.  **The era of government backed legal tender is drawing to an end.**
    Money is way to important to allow governments to control it.
    Abominations like the Federal Reserve are as obsolete and morally
    repugnant as slavery.

To help bring about the glorious day when shitheads in government no
longer *create money out of thin fucking nothing* and give it to their bum
buddies I am encouraging all of you to start using cryptocurrencies. [You can start by tipping
