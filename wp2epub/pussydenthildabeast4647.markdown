My blood moon photography didn’t turn out because I didn’t. Come
midnight fatigue, familiarity and spotty weather conspired to send this
exhausted W2[^4647a] drone to bed. It’s just as well; if you’re not doing
consider sleeping. In six months I’ll get another shot at photographing
a blood moon. For the nonce, I’ll muse on menstrual moon madness.
Exactly what Earth shaking event does this terrible tetrad foretell?

But now, in the blood moon discharge, it’s clear a fate worse than
community organizers awaits a pummeled public. Behold, *Pussydent
Hildabeast*,[^4647b] a rough nagging crone, her ["hour come round at
last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be
born?"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Coming_(poem))

[^4647a]: W2 is a basic IRS tax form in the United State. I calculate my
    taxes by hand. I sometimes do the arithmetic on paper just to
    increase the pain and rage. Taxation should hurt and in my case it
    does. Taxes are by far the largest “line item” in my budget, but
    what the heck, lesbians on welfare need free birth control.

[^4647b]: A Pussydent is a *metaphorically ball-less* president and a
    Hildabeast is Hillary Clinton.
