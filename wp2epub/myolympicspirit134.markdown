The US tax payer dodged a bullet yesterday (October 2, 2009). The
[IOC](http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/), that cabal of corrupt
whores, awarded the Olympics to Rio instead of Chicago. I’ve seen Rio,
it’s a beautiful city, and I pity the poor people there that will soon
be paying out the [wazoo](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wazoo) for
the dubious honor of enduring another installment of the world’s largest
publicly funded real estate orgy followed by a two week [drug
enhanced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use\_of\_performance-enhancing\_drugs\_in\_the\_Olympic\_Games)
circus of the inane.
