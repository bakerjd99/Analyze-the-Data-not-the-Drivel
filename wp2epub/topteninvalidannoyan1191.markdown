I have been in the rehab/old-folks home for eight days: long enough to
adjust to the routine. It’s amazing how quickly we get on with a new
normal. This doesn’t mean I am comfortable or thrilled with my
circumstances. I have a list of invalid annoyances.

Let’s do this from least to most annoying.

1.  Call bells that ring for hours on end.

2.  Marginal cable package: cripples don’t need HBO.

3.  Late night nurse chats; I had forgotten about noisy hospitals.

4.  Butt-plugging food. They have been trying to give me stool softeners
    since my arrival. If my wife wasn’t bringing food I would need them.

5.  Locked courtyards. It’s winter and the courtyards are locked to
    protect the elderly. This should be a weather dependent rather than
    seasonal policy.

6.  Inability to put on my socks.

7.  Unable to get in or out of my wheelchair without assistance.

8.  Cannot shower or bathe until my cuts heal

9.  Peeing into a plastic bottle.

10. And the number one annoyance: **cannot wipe my ass.** I suspect my
    nurses concur.
