Tell me if you've had this dream. For urgent *dream-reasons*[^6065x1] you
must call someone. You reach for your phone but it isn't there! You
frantically search for it. It isn't in your pockets, on your desk,
beside the couch, or in your car. Where the Hell is it? In desperation,
you root through your closets and find one of your old phones. You're
saved! Relieved you try calling only to find the old phone doesn't work;
it's broken. Lately, I've had repeated versions of this dream. The
missing and broken cellphone dream is the new
*going-to-school-without-pants* dream.

[^6065x1]: Dream reasons are compelling in the dream but often vanish on
    waking.
