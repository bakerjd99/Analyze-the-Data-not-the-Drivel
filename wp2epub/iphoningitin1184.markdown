Last week I fell in Faust park and tore the quadriceps muscles above
both knees. Right now I am in a skilled nursing home waiting for a
change in my “weight-bearing” status. For the time being I cannot stand
or even bend my knees. An outing consists of being helped into a
wheelchair and rolling around the halls.

The nursing home lacks Internet access so my wife, to cheer me up, got
me an iPhone with a good data plan. The iPhone is an awesome little
gadget but it’s not easy to type on it. I am pecking this blog entry in
bed one little character at a time. I know I won’t have the energy to
revise my iPhone blog entries so you get what I peck.
