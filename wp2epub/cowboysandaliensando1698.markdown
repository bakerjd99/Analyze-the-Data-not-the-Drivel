Cowboys and Aliens ($CB$) had me at the title! Throwing Indiana Jones,
James Bond and House’s 13, (Olivia Wilde - the thinking man’s smoking
hot babe), into the mix merely turned a ridiculous premise into a
cosmically absurd proposition. How could I resist?

There’s no point issuing spoiler alerts, like a fine Obama speech, this
schizophrenic masterpiece cannot be spoiled.

Yes I hear your [little
people](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/267605/safe-sex-and-taxes-are-little-people-victor-davis-hanson)
objections, but bear with me. If we ***throw fun [under the
bus](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08184/894024-51.stm)*** then $CB$ is
the cinematic equivalent of a typical Obama speech.

Let’s review the evidence:

1.  $CB$ mashes together tired old western and science-fiction clichés
    without the slightest regard for antiquated notions like coherence
    and plausibility.

2.  Obama ($OB$) mashes together tired old political clichés without the
    slightest regard for antiquated notions like effectiveness and
    reality.

3.  $CB$ conjures up big nasty bug-like aliens that literally blind the
    people with science so they can harvest their [precious bodily
    fluids](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY).

4.  $OB$ conjures up big nasty Tea Party Republicans that blind the
    people with
    [arithmetic](http://www.ardue.org.uk/world/finarith.html) so they
    can [balance the
    budget](http://www.thedailylink.org/2005/04/good-god-just-balance-fucking-budget.html).

5.  $CB$ rails against the [gold
    standard](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GoldStandard.html). See
    the movie

6.  $OB$ rails against the gold standard. See the Federal Reserve.

7.  $CB$ is confused.

8.  $OB$ ditto.

Analogies are never perfect and eventually the $CB = OB$ symmetry breaks
down. In $CB$ it all works out! After dispatching the aliens the good
guys are better off. When we finally *dispatch* Obama I doubt any of us
will be better off.
