----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Posted: 05 May 2015 02:59:11*

*While updating an online version of my resume a nagging web page
advised me to include a personal statement: apparently the personal
statement is my chance to stand out, make that all-important first
impression, and firmly affix my lips to succulent corporate ass.*

*Being programmer oriented, the web page suggested I write about my first
computer. This is just conniving HR speak for, “How old are you?” HR cannot
directly ask so they’ll probe circuitously. Sorry gals, (HR is a female
ghetto), I’m on to you. I am excellent actor and liar. I can play your
little game but I am no longer interested. Still your little page made
we wonder what my personal statement would be like if I was telling the
truth and not spinning like a millisecond pulsar. I think it would look
something like this:*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to solve problems: not create them. You would be surprised how
many software organizations cannot tell the difference.

Ask yourself:

1.  Does your organization think the orthodox application of trendy
    project management “methodologies”[^5035a] like agile is a substitute
    for real insight and work?

2.  Do you bind yourself in SOX inspired straitjackets and wonder why
    programmer morale and productivity has plummeted?

3.  Do you have an antiquated remote work policy and insist staff show
    up for periodic management brow beatings and pointless brain numbing
    meetings?

4.  Are you wedded to standard software tools merely because they are
    standard?

5.  Are you afraid of iconoclastic viewpoints and meekly seek a lowest
    common denominator consensus?

6.  Finally, do you follow industry trends or set them?

Perhaps my bad attitude shocks you.

“Who would hire this guy?” you ask.

It’s a fair question. I’ve had my fill of “Software Theater.” I will no
longer act like I agree with bad ideas just to get along. From now on I
am going to tell people what I really think, not what they yearn to
hear.

To work with me your organization must be:

1.  Located somewhere I want to live to or have an enlightened 21^st^
    century remote work policy.

I am tired of wasting my life in humdrum hellholes because that’s where
an employer is located. This is inexcusable for 21^st^ century software
developers. If you haven’t figured out how to manage geographically
dispersed remote workers your organization is hidebound, myopic and
doomed!

2.  Have a positive attitude about novel approaches to problems and
    encourage programmer autonomy.

I have often solved problems with nonstandard tools and techniques only
to be told to do it again using a standard tool. Sometimes this makes
sense but usually it’s motivated by pure organizational fear.

“Oh my God we won’t be able to find someone to support this!”

Or even worse, “We’ll have to learn something new!”

Companies make a big show about “thinking outside the box” while
huddling like bed wetting cowards in the corner of one.

3.  Accept the simple fact that work is small part of life and stop
    trying to manage employees outside of the workplace.

It’s amazing what some companies think they can get away with! Would you
believe [asking recruits for Facebook and Twitter
passwords?](https://mashable.com/2012/04/08/employer-facebook-password)
Don’t try this with me; I might punch you! Most companies know that
asking for passwords crosses all sorts of inappropriate boundaries but
even more enlightened organizations often have a “velvet fist” social
media policy that basically tells employees not to involve the company
in their personal jackassery. This is a reasonable request but it’s
usually seen as bullying. Most will shut up: not me! Freedom of speech
is fundamental and absolute. Companies that try to silence employees
should be ashamed of themselves.

If you’re still reading and think, *I like the cut of this guy’s jib. We
have enough kowtowing eunuchs on payroll: a few ballsy shitheads may
spruce this joint up.* I’d suggest you look over my attached resume,
peruse my [public GitHub repositories](https://github.com/bakerjd99),
read my blog, browse my [extensive
photos](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com), and check out what I’m
[reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5664087-john?utf8=%E2%9C%93&shelf=read&sort=date_read&order=d).
You’ll get a pretty accurate sense of who I am, what turns my crank, how
I approach problems, and how I deal with difficulties. Unspoken social
conventions demand that we suppress ourselves to work. I will no longer
do this. *I am what I am; I do what do; I will not change for you.*

[^5035a]: I loathe the word “methodologies.” The correct word is “methods.”
    Wanton syllable inflation is a reliable bullshit tell.
