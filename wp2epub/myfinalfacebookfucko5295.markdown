It’s the start of a new year and much has changed. This week we moved
into a new house. Our move has been an eight month and four state ordeal
but I am hoping we will be here for some time. I am tired of moving and
our frequent moves are confusing our self-appointed digital overlords.
This afternoon, after unpacking and assembling the table I am now
writing on, I tried to login to Facebook using a borrowed library
hotspot. The Boise Library consortium is now lending out Internet
Hotspot devices. My wife put one on hold about a month ago and she got
an email the other day that the device was ready to be picked up at the
Eagle branch. It will be a week or two before our local broadband
supplier can wire up our new house so the hotspot perfectly hit our
Internet dead spot. We picked it up and I’m using it now.

Getting back to Facebook. My login attempt failed. Facebook detected yet
another change in my connection IP address and asked me to verify my
account. I’ve done this before. I was expecting a text or reset email
but no, this time the bastards had the sheer unmitigated gall to ask for
proper government ID. They want scans of driver’s licenses, passports,
social security cards and so forth. This was the last straw. I couldn’t
even login to delete my account so I sent this message to
security@facebookmail.com.
