Another year of [**blogging
bad**](https://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/21-things-youre-sick-of-hearing-if-you-dont-watc).
My mother’s death and work were major distractions this year; I fell way
short of my post goals but still managed to exceed the previous year’s
hit count and set a new high.  To show their appreciation the good
algorithms at [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) sent us an annual
report. Mine follows:

The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2013 annual report for
this blog.

Here’s an excerpt:

> The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This
> blog was viewed about **11,000** times in 2013. If it were a concert
> at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 4 sold-out performances for
> that many people to see it.
