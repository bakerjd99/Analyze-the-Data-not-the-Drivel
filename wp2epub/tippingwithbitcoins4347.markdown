For the last two days my elderly laptop has struggled with the
[bitcoin-qt](http://bitcoin.org/en/download) client while it downloaded
and checked the entire Bitcoin block chain. This is one of the
fascinating things about this “currency.” Its entire global transaction
history is public. It occurred to me that the Bitcoin economy is now
large enough to verify basic macro economic equations. You can precisely
calculate the “velocity of money” from Bitcoin blocks.

Now that I have synchronized with the Bitcoin network all I need is some
coin to play with. If you would like to send me a few micro Bitcoins I
will send them right back. I want to observe the transfer process.
Please use this address. Think of it as a blog tip jar.
