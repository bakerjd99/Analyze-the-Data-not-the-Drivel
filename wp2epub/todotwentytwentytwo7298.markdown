I'm so bad at making and keeping New Years Resolutions that I typically
put them off until February. I've always been a procrastinator and I've
always told myself that I'm going to change, but not today. Tossing
Calvinistic guilt aside procrastination isn't all bad, it gives you time
to mull over your plans before making them public. Well, my mulling is
done and my plans for 2022 are itching to embarrass me. Hang on
cowgirls, this is my agenda for 2022.

For 2022 I'm limiting my goals to one big *job* and a handful of smaller
tasks. My big job: write the first draft of a short book that uses
[LEAN](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) to *formally* prove some
ancient geometric theorems. This is a continuation of my LEAN studies
from last year. I am fully aware that I may be setting myself up for
colossal failure as this may be utterly beyond me! It will take a
sustained effort to master an unfamiliar tool and translate informal
proofs into a strictly formal language. I'd say it's comparable to
assembling a hobby computer from component parts and then writing a new
small OS, from scratch, in an unfamiliar assembly language. I expect
lots of hard slogging.

*I don't slog well!*

This is where my smaller tasks come in. I'll use my little tasks to give
myself breaks from my big job's anticipated drudgery. Here they are:

1.  Observe as many Messier and other objects as weather permits. I've
    seen 66 Messier objects. It's time to complete the list, (yeah I'm
    keeping track), and get my [RASC Messier
    Certificate](https://www.rasc.ca/observing/messier-certificate).

2.  Learn more proper northern hemisphere star names. I live in a
    light-polluted suburban area. *Light pollution is an abomination in
    dire need of elimination* but that's not going to happen. Light
    pollution, like plastic crap in the ocean, and global warming will
    be here long after I'm not. If you cannot eliminate an abomination
    work with it. Light polluted skies are what I call *beginner skies*.
    All but the brighter stars are washed out and, to no one's surprise,
    it's the brighter, magnitude three and below stars,[^7298x1] that have proper
    names. Every night I go out on my little patio and attempt to call
    out all the properly named stars in view. It's a silly thing but
    it's amazing how much you see by simply looking.

3.  Continue shooting and adding captioned images to [my pictures
    site](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/). I should pass 5,000
    online pictures this year.

4.  Read at least ten books. This is about half the number of books I
    typically task myself with. My book reading rules are strict. I
    force myself to *completely read* books before counting them. Sadly,
    this rule ignores much of my reading. Like everyone else on Earth, I
    spend hours reading my goddamn phone. This year I will be *partly
    reading* many books in pursuit of my main goal; they will just have
    to go uncounted.

5.  Blog more! I keep nagging myself to write more, maybe this year I'll
    listen to myself.

In 2023 we'll gather here, at the old *Drivel Dome,* to review my
accomplishments or lack thereof.

[^7298x1]: The brightest objects have low or negative magnitude numbers.
