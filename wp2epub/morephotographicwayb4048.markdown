There are three things I like about funerals: meeting old friends and
relatives, unlimited quantities of food and
[browsing old
photographs](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/the-joys-of-photographic-waybacking/).
A few weeks ago my sister and sister-in-law went through my mother’s
closets and found a stash of old photographs that had eluded my frequent
attempts to catalog and archive family pictures.

I have a thing about family pictures. If you want to piss me off make a
big pile of your family’s pictures and set them on fire! For reasons
that are utterly inexplicable to me many of you don’t seem to give a
damn about your family pictures. My wife’s father was a very organized
photographer that took hundreds, maybe thousands, of black and white
snapshots in Iran from the 1940s to the 1970s. Apparently he took the
time to meticulously label each print with where, when and who
information. I would love to paw through his pictures but that’s not
possible because his kids, my wife’s siblings, trashed most of his
pictures. The few that survive, [like this one of him sitting and reading
a newspaper](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/My-Wifes-Family/7081266\_Gq5ZQB\#!i=473480027\&k=f2jN5SP\&lb=1\&s=A), hint
at a *never to seen again world.*

Such crimes against imagery are common. My maternal grandmother was also
a keen *unorganized* photographer. She didn’t label prints or neatly
file slides but she shot everything that caught her eye. Over six
decades she piled up thousands of images, but when she moved into town,
she accidentally sold stacks of what she thought were empty slide
carousels to yard sale strangers. Some of the carousels were empty but
the rest held the bulk or her slide collection. The surviving images,
like this [old Kodachrome of my great-grandmother and her sister](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/From-Hazels-Albums-1/7104752\_FZK4j4\#!i=475252263\&k=s7FVxLV\&lb=1\&s=A), constantly
remind me of all the great shots I will never
see! Don’t trash your family pictures you will grow to regret it.

My mother’s recently recovered stash held a few gems I had never seen
like this [great little snapshot of my maternal grandmother with her two
daughters](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/From-Hazels-Albums-1/7104752\_FZK4j4\#!i=2524884643\&k=WcQmrR4\&lb=1\&s=A): my late mother
as a pouty girl and my aunt as a baby. The
old car in the background would be marked down as a “distracting
element” in many photography classes. This merely shows how bad the
advice and guidelines dispensed in such courses can be. The car is an
essential element; it turns a nice snapshot into a sweet period piece.

Here’s another [snapshot of my mother and aunt with a puppy](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/From-Hazels-Albums-1/7104752\_FZK4j4\#!i=2525057933\&k=DsggvtX\&lb=1\&s=A). 
This picture is almost seventy years old but I still
see the same expression on my aunt’s face. Your smile is a lifelong
affliction; I would recommend getting used to it.

Along with the *amateur* snapshots a number of professional studio
portraits turned up. The following is a [hand tinted print of my mother](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/From-Hazels-Albums-1/7104752\_FZK4j4\#!i=2521568789\&k=sg9BR5f\&lb=1\&s=A) 
as a ten-year old. Color
photography obliterated the art of hand tinting. It is rarely seen
outside of photographic art classes today. Tinting is often unnatural
and hokey but it sometimes lends an eerie painting quality. Here the
tinting works. Tinted prints are becoming rare and valuable. Don’t throw
them away!

Finally, here’s a wonderful never seen [portrait of my mother as an
eleven year old](https://conceptcontrol.smugmug.com/People/From-Hazels-Albums-1/7104752\_FZK4j4\#!i=2521568625\&k=86Sn8rs\&lb=1\&s=A).
This may be the best portrait
of my mother at any age. The studio photographer caught her in the
middle of a great smile. This picture was taken over six decades ago but
I doubt that modern imaging technology could significantly improve it.

Finding this portrait shortly after my mother’s death took away some of
the sting. I had a great mother, and because I treat family pictures
with the respect they deserve, I have the photographic evidence to prove
it.
