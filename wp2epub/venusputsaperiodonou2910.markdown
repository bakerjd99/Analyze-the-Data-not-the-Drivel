I left work early yesterday to scoot down to Forest Park, one of
St. Louis’s best city parks, and take in the transit of Venus. The
[St. Louis Astronomical Society](https://www.slasonline.org/) conducted a
public outreach event on the grounds of the World’s Fair Pavilion. The
pavilion sits atop a small hill with a good view of the western horizon.
Many club members had set up telescopes for the public. Some scopes
projected images of the sun and others used solar filters. It was
[another large daytime star
party](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/the-wahweap-wow/).
Hundreds of people showed up and patiently waited in telescope lines to
get a glimpse of Venus crossing the Sun.

The mood was curious and somber; parents urged their children to look
and remember. Many dutifully complied but you could see they were more
interested in running around the pavilion than watching a little black
dot. Maybe some will remember in the decades to come; maybe one or two
will live to see the next transit but for the rest of us the little
black dot of Venus is a “period” to the sentence of our time. We will
never see Venus’s silhouette on the Sun again. Venus will circle on
punctuating future epochs but we, my friends, will soon cease to exist —
period.
