My doubts about the Nobel Peace Prize started when Henry Kissinger and
Le Duc Tho won during the Vietnam war. In my naive youth I thought a
peace prize might have something to do with *peace*! I was so cute and
unsophisticated in those days. As I aged I developed a robust sense of
irony but when Yasser Arafat won the peace prize I was again
dumbfounded. How could an outright unrepentant murderer qualify for a
peace prize? Clearly my sense of the absurd needed work. I labored long
and hard and when Jimmy Carter won for not being George Bush I took it
in stride. Then Al Gore won for saving the Earth from global warming.
Again my cynical detachment required tuning. What did global warming
have to do with peace? Did I miss all the brutal carbon dioxide wars?
Finally I understood. *The Nobel Peace Prize has nothing to do with
Peace!* Of course I still foolishly harbored some illusions that you had
to do stuff. This morning, upon learning that Barak Obama had won, I
divested my final illusions about the peace prize. The Nobel Peace Prize
is now worth less than a *[Canadian
Idol](https://www.ctv.ca/idol/gen/Home.html)* win. At least some Canadian
Idols can sing and dance.
