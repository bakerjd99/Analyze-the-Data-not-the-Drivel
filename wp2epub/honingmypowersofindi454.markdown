For years I thought it was rude to ignore people now I glory in it. In
our overly social networked age it is vital to hone your powers of
indifference. We cannot care about everyone or everything and we
shouldn’t even try. Here are some people and issues I am ignoring.

1.  **Gay Marriage:** Gay marriage is not a human rights issue. The real
    problem is a property issue. When gay dudes expire their partners
    frequently complain, (gay people complaining how novel), about how
    mean and nasty people are about settling estates and dividing up the
    booty. What the hell does this have to do with marriage? I am in
    favor of abolishing all tax and property distinctions between the
    married and unmarried and reinforcing property rights. It frosts my
    balls that unmarried wage earners subsidize married people with
    higher per capita taxes. It pisses me off that drag queens cannot
    leave their millions to their bum buddies without sleazy estate
    fights. [If your property rights are not protected your human rights
    are irrelevant.](http://mises.org/daily/2569)

2.  **Global warming:** Yeah, the world is slowly warming and it might
    be a problem by the middle of this century. Unfortunately by the
    middle of the century I am dead so, for me, global warming is like
    the increase in the [Sun’s luminosity a billion years from
    now](http://j.dollan.home.bresnan.net/MUSunLife.html) or, even
    worse, [when all the stars go dark in a few hundred trillion
    years.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future\_of\_an\_expanding\_universe#Star\_formation\_ceases)
    Fifty years, a billion years, a hundred trillion years it doesn’t
    matter I am still dead. Next issue please.

3.  **President Obama**: I had a bad feeling when I heard his [infamous
    oceans rolled back
    speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2pZSvq9bto) during the
    Democratic convention. It was one of those spectacularly stupid
    remarks that forever stain one’s reputation. Well after two years of
    campaigning and one year of inept governing it’s official: nothing
    to learn here. My strategy now is to limit this administration’s
    damage to *moi!* The rest of you can enjoy your hope and change.

4.  **Creationists**: Life does not make sense without evolution just
    like mountain ranges and deep-sea trenches do not make sense without
    continental drift. Very few creationists rail against continental
    drift because we can see it happening. The
    [VLBI](http://www.evlbi.org/links/links.html) radio telescope array
    is calibrated on a regular basis because the antennas are sitting on
    moving continental plates and the precise millimeter scale distance
    between them is always changing. The process of evolution is still
    up and running and will be long after [all creationist
    dipshits](http://creationistidiocy.blogspot.com/2009/02/morons-of-month-holy-trinity-of-stupid.html)
    are fossilized.

5.  **Stock Tips and other Financial prognostications**: Investing your
    own money is a wonderful education in the fallibility of prophets.
    If it was so damn easy we would all be rich. I observe the contrary.

6.  **CNN. MSNBC, FOX, ABC, NBC, CBC and BBC news**: Please just
    [FOAD](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=F.O.A.D.) and
    free up some valuable bandwidth. You are no longer relevant and are
    simply wasting our time.
