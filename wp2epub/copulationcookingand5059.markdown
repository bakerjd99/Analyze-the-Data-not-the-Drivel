A refreshing
[blogosphere](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blogosphere)
development is something called the
[“manosphere.”](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Manosphere)
The manosphere is a mangy collection of young male bloggers that have
had it with man hating feminism. I’m an old boomer fart, not exactly the
manosphere demographic, but I see their point. I remember when rational
feminists[^1x5059] set their sights on “equal pay for equal work.” I fully
supported pay equity and, when you correct for [actual hours
worked](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2012/04/16/its-time-that-we-end-the-equal-pay-myth/),
that battle has been won in *oppressive western cultures.*[^2x5059] But, as
every married man knows, what women ask for is seldom what they really
want.

Equity was never the goal of radical feminists! Radical feminists are
nasty menstruating socialists. Their perfect world looks a lot like an
old-fashioned [new-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Soviet_man)
communist utopia: a utopia that was rudely rejected for all sorts of
[Gulag’ey](https://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2008/08/death_of_a_writer.html)
reasons. Sadly, radical feminists don’t take rejection gracefully. Once
a month their bitter frustrations manifest as malignant misandry. Yeah,
“femnazis” are real and they’re everywhere! Femnazicism rears its ugly
bull dyke head in repressive [campus speech
codes](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html?_r=0),
phony palimony suits, [bogus rape
claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape), “fat
acceptance” campaigns, and tiresome PMS laced whining about how hard it
is to find a *real* man. Well ladies, I am going to let you in on a
little guy secret; *it’s much harder to find a real woman!*

What I am about to say will strike manospherians, and real men
everywhere, as obvious but we can no longer count on men being men.
There are a lot of misguided [white
knights](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=White+Knight)
and whipped [manginas](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fun:Mangina) out
there so grab your sanitary napkins and brace for reality.

*In pre-pussy-boy days, men looked for, fought over, and highly valued
“three C” women.*

What the hell is a “three C” woman? A three C woman understands men. She
has intuitively, or intellectually, grasped that human males are simple
short-lived creatures that are biologically programmed to seek three
things from woman: *copulation, cooking and cleaning* - the three Cs.

You can determine a man’s age by how he sorts his three Cs. When we’re
young copulation is our absolute number one priority. Given a choice
between copulation, cooking and cleaning we’ll always pick copulation.
When we’re older, more settled, and our frantic need for copulation
subsides, given a choice of fine cuisine or fine ass, we may choose the
former. Finally, in our limp dotage, when Viagra no longer works, gently
wiping the dribble off our chins, (cleaning), after a fine meal,
(cooking), is greatly appreciated. Ladies if the three Cs are graciously
on tap we’ll happily put up with any amount of lady-shit. It sounds
simple because it is![^3x5059] 

Bang us, feed us, and cleanup afterwards,
*without nagging resentment,* and we will love, cherish, protect, work,
and die for you! And, here’s the good news; you don’t have to be a
Victoria Secret maximum babe to pull this off. In purely economic terms
any comely young woman who masters the three Cs is literally worth her
weight in gold![^4x5059] At current gold prices [one woman
weight](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=dollar+value+of+60kg+gold)
is about \$2,300.000 US. Amortized over a fifty year marriage that works
out to around \$45,000 per year. Guys, just try paying for hookers,
gourmet takeout, and maid services for a measly \$45,000 a year. When
you throw *love* into the deal the quality three C woman is the biggest
bargain out there. So ladies, if you really want a *real* man, master
your three Cs and you’ll have your pick of them.

[^1x5059]: *Rational feminist* was not oxymoronic when the movement started.

[^2x5059]: Not such much in [Clitoridectomy happy
    nonwestern](https://thefederalist.com/2014/07/07/the-pathetic-provincialism-of-american-feminists/)
    societies.

[^3x5059]: Male maintenance requires some real work. Men expect to put in
    long hours looking after the women in their lives and they expect
    women to reciprocate. Unfortunately modern feminism labels such
    reciprocation “oppression.”

[^4x5059]: I am assuming a normal female weight of less than sixty-five
    kilograms. *Obese land fe-whales* are not worth their weight in
    gold.
