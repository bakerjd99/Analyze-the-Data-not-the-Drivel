It’s 2018. 2018 has prime factors of 2 and 1009, e.g.
2018 = 2 * 1009.

Did anything happen in the years 2 and 1009?

1.  [In the year 2](https://www.onthisday.com/events/date/2) Venus and
    Jupiter were in conjunction. Some speculate this may have been the
    “Star of Bethlehem.”

2.  [In 1009](https://www.onthisday.com/events/october/18) the Church of
    Holy Sepulcher was destroyed.

How odd, the prime factors of 2018 yield two Jesus related events,
separated by over a thousand years that are mysteriously tied to his
birthplace. Evidently, the Star of Bethlehem marked the beginning, 1009
marked the middle, and 2018 is the end! *Repent, the rapture is upon
us!* Better buckle up non-gender specific bovine control officers
(cowboys) 2018 is going to be rough.

Just how rough you ask? Imagine hordes of underachieving and mostly
useless bureaucrats forced to take an impromptu paid holiday[^5552a] because
even more useless legislators cannot agree on how to spend other
people’s money. Let’s hope the government stays shutdown down until the
imminent rapture renders it redundant.

My calculations cannot pinpoint the exact time and date of the rapture.
My guess would be the first[^5552b] [blood moon of the year, January 31,

*It’s getting to the point where it’s no longer possible to be satirical
because somewhere on the intertubes you’ll find true believers that go
way beyond satire.*

[^5552a]: None of the furiously furloughed will miss a single damn paycheck.
    Where can I get a job that pays me to sit on my ass and whine about
    whatever the idiot talking point of the day is?

[^5552b]: 2018 has two total lunar eclipses. If we’re not raptured on
    January 31^st^ wait until [July
    27^th^](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2018Jul27T.pdf)

[^5552c]: Sky Fairy consultants, also known as prophets, have high overhead
    and need substantial donations to maintain their close connections
    with the divine.
