![](adndsymsmall.png) [TODO](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/)
===============================================================

Pending and considered changes for [Analyze the Data not the Drivel](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/)
source files.

The base 36 GUID key is stable over the lifetime of a task. 

Note: I use a number of Version Control Systems (VCS). The base 36 GUID
is my key for relating issues, tickets and so forth across systems.

`[begin-todo]`

1. `<_5u5iygqpeea7oict0qabc0g4k_>` Standardize image link text in markdown version.

2. `<_7oa1iac9gtez9tpxgb8lpqgq8_>` Explore better table of contents layouts in eBook versions.

3. `<_ass0kzc30qat8qqqtichqoy2d_>` Generate single and two level `toc.ncx` xml files from `bm.tex`. Not all eBook readers
   can some multiple levels in table of contents. Kindle `mobi` is apparently one level only.

4. `<_08864qa8dtrsnn3v7cjrqsfjn_>` Revise cover graphics for eBook and PDF versions.

5. `<_654evucdxhl38fch2q9renkyo_>` Come up with a better blog icon.
